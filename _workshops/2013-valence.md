<p>During this workshop, we'll use NodeBox to visualize large sets of data. Through a visual, node-based approach, we'll create interesting and unique visualizations that evolve and react on varying input. We'll learn how to capture, prepare, visualize and refine data.</p>

<p>This workshop is for designers new to NodeBox and data visualization. We will learn to look at data differently, and gain insight in how to create new and interesting designs.</p>

<p>This workshop takes place at the <a href="http://esad-gv.fr/">École Supérieure d'Art et Design </a> in Valence, France.</p>
