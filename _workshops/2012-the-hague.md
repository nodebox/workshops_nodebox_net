<p>This website is a liveblog of a <a href="http://nodebox.net/node/">NodeBox 3</a> workshop on Data Visualization taking place in The Hague, The Netherlands, 5 - 9 November 2012. We'll learn how to capture, prepare, visualize and refine data. The end result will be a poster with a visualization around a self-chosen theme. </p>

<p>This workshop is for designers new to NodeBox and data visualization. We will learn to look at data differently, and gain insight in how to create new and interesting designs. </p>
