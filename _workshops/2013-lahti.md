<p>This website is a liveblog of a <a href="http://www.nodebox.net/">NodeBox 3</a> workshop on Generative Design taking place in Lahti, Finland from February 25 to March 1 2013. In this workshop we use NodeBox 3, a new software tool that can be used to quickly create "recipes" that generate 2D visuals. Using handles and control widgets it becomes very easy to manipulate the output produced. The data that serves as input of the visuals can be created by the users themselves or it can come from an external source, like data gathered from the internet, or from external input devices like OSC (Open Sound Control) or Kinect. The purpose of the workshop is to keep a sketch book in which the students show what they have created.</p>
