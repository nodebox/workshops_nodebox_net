<p>During this workshop, we'll use a new tool well suited for visualizing data. Through a visual, node-based approach, we'll create interesting and unique visualizations that evolve and react on varying input. We'll learn how to capture, prepare, visualize and refine data.</p>

<p>This workshop is for designers new to NodeBox and data visualization. We will learn to look at data differently, and gain insight in how to create new and interesting designs.</p>

<pData is taking over your life. It's time to take control.</p>

<p>This workshop takes place in the <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/">Aalto University</a> in Helsinki, Finland.</p>
