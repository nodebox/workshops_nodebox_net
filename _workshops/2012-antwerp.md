<p>This website is a liveblog of a <a href="http://nodebox.net/">NodeBox</a> workshop on Data Visualization taking place in Antwerp, Belgium, 13 - 17 February 2012. We'll learn how to capture, prepare, visualize and refine data. The end result will be a poster with a visualization around a self-chosen theme.</p>

<p>This workshop is for designers new to NodeBox and data visualization. We will learn to look at data differently, and gain insight in how to create new and interesting designs.</p>
