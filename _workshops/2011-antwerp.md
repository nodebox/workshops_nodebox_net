<p>Welcome to Patterns of Data, a workshop held from Monday 28 February - Friday 4 March 2011  in <a href="http://www.sintlucasantwerpen.be/">Sint Lucas Antwerpen</a> and presented by Lieven Menschaert and Frederik De Bleser.</p>

<p>This workshop is for designers new to NodeBox. We will learn to look at data differently, and gain insight into how to create new and interesting visualizations. We will use <a href="http://nodebox.net/">NodeBox 2</a> to produce a data visualization around a self-chosen theme.</p>
