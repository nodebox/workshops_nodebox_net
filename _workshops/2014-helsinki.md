<p>During this workshop, we'll use a new tool well suited for visualizing data. Through a visual, node-based approach, we'll create interesting and unique visualizations that evolve and react on varying input.</p>

<p>This workshop is for designers new to NodeBox, data visualization and generative design. We will learn to look at data differently, and gain insight in how to create new and interesting designs.</p>

<p>A workshop held from January 27 till January 31 at <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/">Aalto University</a> in Helsinki, Finland.</p>
