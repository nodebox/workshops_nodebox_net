1. Visualizing twitter census of the number of smileys Counts from users over one year&nbsp;</b><b>&nbsp;</b><b>Dataset:&nbsp;</b><a href="http://http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/twitter-census-conversation-metrics-one-year-of-urls-hashtags-sm--3">here</a>
<br /><b>Initial Plan</b>
<br />I intend to create a prototype visualising user activity--before, during and after a TV show; using feeds from the respective twitter Channel. If successful I would later like to explore the possibility of viewing shared content (video, screenshots) on the mapped activity.&nbsp;<br />This idea is probably for later as pulling tweets from conservative TV channels is a limited affair :)<br />
