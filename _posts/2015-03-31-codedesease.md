/The aim is create a illustration that visualy reminds a desease./
Why a desease? Cos I want to show to the world all the bad things of the world, that we just not live in a happy world -> demonstrate how big that desease can be. (be realistic)

That is, I would create surveys in wich the people would answer it (anonymously) and from each category of survey different forms would appear in the  illustration so...it would start to form becoming that "desease" microrganism made from the people, but mainly made of code.

But until these happens, my idea will be created with stablished surveys
