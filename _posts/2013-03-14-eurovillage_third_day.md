<p class="MsoNormal">Today we decided to explore the relationships between the
Eurovision countries by revealing the sum of the points they gave each other
throughout the period of 1975-2003 years when semifinals has began. Our goal is to express how strong the
relationships between certain countries are. Maybe we will expose
"BFFs" between some of the contestants :)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Each country would be pictured as the system of the planet
and its satellites:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">- Planet: the country<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">- Its Satellites: Other countries that the particular
country gave the points to AND received the points from</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The bigger is its satellite, the closer is the distance
between means the stronger relationship.</p>
