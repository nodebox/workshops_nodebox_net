I am creating a classic map visualization with commercial ports, vessels and their routes. I am using a data set with 14 vessels and their activity during one month. I can also use wider time scale and create monthly based comparisons. I am still thinking about the possibility of combining AIS information with my visualization (marinetraffic.com).
