After turning my brain to lingonberry jam with NodeBox yesterday, I tried to make the anatomy of my idea clearer to myself.

So, I have to starting points: the document format, and the inputted word. The size and placement of the elements would be related to the format and the content would be derived from the word. Does this make any sense to anyone but me?

Anyway, this way it is be easier to figure out what are the steps which I have to take and in which order I should take them. My idea is pretty simple but there are complicated parts needed to complete it. With great help from Tom and Lucas I have managed to piece together some parts of the puzzle but there still some missing, and some not quite fitting. NodeBox wizards from the Future, please come to my aid!
<p style="text-align: center;">Some issues:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I can get text translated from english to japanese but not back to english from japanese. Something to do with unicode?</li>
	<li>The document width/height ratio resizing the headline text doesn't quite work. Still, thanks tom! Maybe I just have to find a way around it.</li>
	<li>I still don't know how to retrieve images from the translated word and to place them.</li>
	<li>I have to find a way to make a list of words from the translated word. How could this be done? Search for the word in google and retrieve the first 5-10 labels for that word? Maybe to use something that is used in the wordnet examples like explode and prism...?</li>
</ul>
