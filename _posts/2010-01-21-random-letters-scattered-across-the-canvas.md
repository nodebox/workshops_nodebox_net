The letters are placed on random locations on the canvas, rotated, and more of them in the center of the canvas while less of them in the upper and lower parts. If you play with this make sure the "points" checkbox isn't checked in the final rendered node since there are many, many points. Also adding more rows or columns in the grid1 node will make final rendering much slower, so be careful with that.
