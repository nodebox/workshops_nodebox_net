<strong>A little step for typography, a big step for me//////////////</strong>

<strong><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-844" title="test1" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/test1.png" alt="test1" width="607" height="444" /></strong>

I have to decompose the letter in few parts to combine them for "The Others".

I choosed six fonts 3 with serif and 3 without. And with big contrast in the letter, also betxeen each of them.
