First, this morning we finally found the good concept and we try different ways to putt every information in a coherent posture. A lot of sketches, ideas, and different ways to see graphic design today were borned. 

We finally arrived whit a dorling cartogram with a grid too have a general lookup of all the provinces and the arts categories where the money from the government is spent. 

We now try to understand the way in NodeBox to putt all the information in a manner to be coherent and functional. Next step : cleaning the data!
