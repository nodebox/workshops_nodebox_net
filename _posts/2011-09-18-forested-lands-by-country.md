Summer has rounded the corner and everything is green, so we wanted to make an informative graphic of just how much green there is to be found around the world. The idea is fairly simple; the sizeÂ and deepness of green of the leaf corresponds to the amount of forestation in the country compared to plain land.

Alternatively, trees could be used to represent the amount of forested lands; the bigger and more leafy the tree, the larger the forested area in the countryÂ is. Countries with very little forest in them would be like, twigs protruding from the groundÂ with one or two leaves.
