It would be interesting to use a mindmap that would work similarly to Wordnet. I could imagine that this already exists, and if it does I'd like to use it! Instead of the shared one, this would be individual associations, thoughts and experiences. You wouldn't need to make lots of paper versions but instead you could add countless associations. This would be an interesting way to keep a dream diary. I just found a list of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dream_diaries" target="_blank">published dream diaries and dream blogs</a>, I've never read them but have been interested in my dreams as well as others'.
