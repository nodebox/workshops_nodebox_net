<strong>Branches and nerves </strong>
Today I noticed I maybe want to have shapes like nerve cell, it reflects something about the Jester's nerves. And more like the anti-functionality of em. So I draw again something and messed with it. I also forced some text in this tryout for making the surface little bit more alive.

I also tested some text based surfaces, made in Nodebox. Just idea to fill some shapes maybe with something like this. Readable maybe.

I also tested the L-system template to make some branch shapes in Nodebox. It seems to be quite good tool, even though it takes time to get in it. As the main title says, after six days of creating, seventh should be for resting. At least in some fairytales.
