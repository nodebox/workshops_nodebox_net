Today was the day of the new Nodebox! Totally new interface to work with, lots of bugs and no animation. But really promising and logical.

I'm very pleased to be one of the first users of the new Nodebox. Thanks to the workshop!

This example was done with the new Nodebox. It took only a couple of seconds to create and play with it.<a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/vuck.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-684" title="vuck" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/vuck.jpg" alt="vuck" width="425" height="127" /></a>

 

And the same word in here in a completely different form took a couple of more seconds. Amazing!
