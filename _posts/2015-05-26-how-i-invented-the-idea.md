I'm creating lot's of posters lately, for clients and friends.

During workshops were visualising data, creating crazy grids of some patterns and working with pictures,so I thought I could put it all together and make a prototype of a poster creator.

Some people don't need art posters, just clear or crazy informative ones.
Why not help them so they could make it on their own....
