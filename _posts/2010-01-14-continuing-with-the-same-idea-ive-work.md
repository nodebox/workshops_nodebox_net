Continuing with the same idea, IÂ’ve worked the concept giving volume to shape. The idea is writte the word "internet" with a wide-band cable, so thath the concept has more consistency. I want to put more cable connections to simulate internet networks, and refer to the number of connections that can be in the same network.

I tried to draw many wide-band cable, with different colors, to make a distinction between them, and between the different communications that can be found on the Internet. (I have no scanner and so today I could not hang the picture .... hang it tomorrow).

I've also been looking for pictures to add some concept to the final poster. And I found various scribbles, that reminds me of coiled wires.

I like the idea of doodle because it helps define the concept of connection between different lines and shows the relationships that may exist between them.
