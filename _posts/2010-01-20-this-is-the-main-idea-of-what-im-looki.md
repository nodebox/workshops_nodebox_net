this is the main idea of what I'm looking for my poster. Should be like this more or less.<a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/begin.jpg"><img src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/begin-223x300.jpg" alt="" title="begin" width="223" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-631" /></a>

I want to work more on the cup and still try some different layout.. tomorrow.
