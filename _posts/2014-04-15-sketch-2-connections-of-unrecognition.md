*2 new possible ways of visualizing (connection webs or simplified with territories of unrecognition on a grid with surrounding countries that do not recognise it (but that would lose geographical accuracy))*

Showing the connections of unrecognition between the countries. That might form some kind of "black holes" (the very unrecognized ones) and etc.

I'm starting with the case of Israel-Palestine unrecognition.
