<div>The first idea was to visualize the geographic distribution (on a map of Italy divided by region) of politicians quantity, with a focus on their gender, age and education level. We discard this solution because it appear to be too crowded.<br /><i><br /></i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>Our final idea is to compare the Italian politicians between&nbsp;<b>women and men</b> in administrative levels (<b>region,&nbsp;district, city</b>) at different <b>education level</b> and <b>age</b> distribution.<div>To visualize these data we will use a tree structure.&nbsp;The width of each branch is related to the number of politicians.<br /></div>
