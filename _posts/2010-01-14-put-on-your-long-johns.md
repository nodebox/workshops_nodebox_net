This morning on my way to Lahti, I saw a boy in the train with an awesome shirt. Or to be more precise, the pattern on the shirt was the awesome part. It resembled the patterns on long johns, that traditionally are patterned (and well, mostly ugly) in Finland.

So today, I didn't proceed in my poster project at all. Instead I started to play around with the copy stamping and built an automatic pattern generator, with couple of parameters to play around. Quite good practise, but I suppose tomorrow I REALLY have to start thinking about how to put together my poster.
