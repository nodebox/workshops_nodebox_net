<strong>Playing with only one image</strong>
I continued the patterns with Nodebox. The original image was the A -thing from the sketch of the day two which was multiplied four times. I started with simple thing, I only changed the rotation of one component in the group and copied the group to seven columns. Results are below. This is never ending swamp, but sooo fun to play with. Next I probably print the image and start to search some forms from these combinations, just in case if they will look like a type... by accident.
