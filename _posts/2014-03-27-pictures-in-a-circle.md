I taked 5 colors from every picture.
I made columns for every hour. 
It was almost a beautiful circle.
So, I connected all the colors.
Next: Make a perfect circle!

Now I can see which moment a took the most or less pictures,
for example: at 7 o clock I've never taken any picture!
And I can see my most common colors, 
for example: orange (people color)
