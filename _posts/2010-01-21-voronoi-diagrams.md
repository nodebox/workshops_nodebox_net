A Voronoi diagram is used in computational geometry to calculate the area of closest to a set of points. Specifically, it is used in NodeBox to have fun.

This version is not finished yet but already pretty fun. The main code is not written by me, but based on an algorithm by Steven Fortune, ported to Python by Bill Simons.
