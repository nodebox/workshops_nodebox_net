The basic visualisation of the amount and size of sunken ships per year now works in nodebox also on a timeline indicating the decades.&nbsp;<br />I am now looking at adding a second dataset, like population growth or wind information per year to implement as a connection.&nbsp;<div><br />The different colours of the Ships are representing their cause of sinking, e.g. grounding or exploding. Those colors will get customized later in Illustrator.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
