I have here an example of one idea, but was too busy with other work to start to do it with Nodebox.<br />My data is in most parts invented, but at some point I will get real data, so I can update the visualization.&nbsp;<br />Hopefully it would look more interesting then. There are probably better visualization ideas, I would be glad to get some.<br />One idea I had was to use boxes, but depends on the real data.<br />
