I tried to put the idea of the birthday calendar in Nodebox. I displayed every facebook-friend's birthday as a dot and organized them in a raster. Some addition of color showed the difference between male and female. After that I tried to work with difference in size. As a test I took the first letter of every person to determine the size. If the person's name starts with an 'A', it would be a small dot. 'B' would be a bit bigger and so on up to 'Z' which had the biggest size. This made it much more interesting visually. The next step is to change a few things to present it more readable and hook up a more logic property of the fb-friend to the sizes of the dots.
