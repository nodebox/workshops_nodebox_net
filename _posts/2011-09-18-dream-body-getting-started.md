After brainstorming for a few hours we ended up wanting to create something from dream/sleep statistics. It was surprisingly difficult to find good data about the subject, but this one seemed interesting: <a href="http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/statistics-for-dreams/">http://dreamhawk.com/dream-encyclopedia/statistics-for-dreams/</a>, especially the "Body in dreams" part.

Our idea is to visualize this data in a way that the size of each body part is determined by how many times it appears in people's dreams. These body parts will form a human figure. We're not sure yet how we'll manage to execute our vision, but the main idea is to use NodeBox as a tool to help us get the size of the body parts right.
