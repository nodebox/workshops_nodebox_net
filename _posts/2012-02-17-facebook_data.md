My facebook microbes<br />&nbsp;The 3 circles stand for 3 different people on facebook. They are all friends. <br />&nbsp;The circles consist of all different particles, these particles represent their friends.<br />&nbsp;The particles are placed in a specific position. The position is based on their <br />relationship to eachother. The closer to the core the 'better' the friend and visa versa.<br />&nbsp;The lines between the 3 circles symbolize shared friends.<br />
