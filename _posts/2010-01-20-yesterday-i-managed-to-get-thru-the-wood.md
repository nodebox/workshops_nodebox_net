Yesterday I managed to get thru the woods with the help of Frederik. But after the technical problems were  conquered, the problems with the layout started to appear more clearly. The idea of assigning each first letter it's own color produced somewhat trippy poster with all the colors of rainbow. So I started to think alternate techniques to use color. Also got an idea of an alternate approach on visualisation. Earlier I though about packing the names so, that they would not overlap, but packing rectangles requires way too high mathematics. Packing sircles on the other hand would maybe be plausible way... but well, time is getting short, so maybe that's something I'll get into some other time...

Meanwhile here's a draft of the poster, with some trippy colours... dude, it's like 70s again!
