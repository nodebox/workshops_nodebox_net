For this masterclass I started with the data I collected over the past few months with RescueTime. With this data I was looking for a way to visualize it in an easily readable and understandable way. Eventually I have chosen for a concept where little monsters are fully formed by my own computer usage.

Starting from this concept I have chosen a period of 1 day per monster, you could say that every day over the past few months a new monster was born.

As mentioned before, the appearance of this monsters totally depends on how and how much I used my computer that day. So will the monsters grow in size if I spend more time behind my computer. Also they will be more happy and light or angry and dark if Im more or less productive that day.
