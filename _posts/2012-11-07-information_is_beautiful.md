For this workshop I will explore structures of musical notation. I do not want to make a poster that is informative and readable but rather a representation of music notation which is surprising. My inspiration is John Maeda and the way he uses data -- in his work beauty of data comes as a mean of expression. I am going to use Johann Sebastian Bach's piece 'Goldberg variations'. I will use data from midi files and try to extract notation to csv list.<br />
