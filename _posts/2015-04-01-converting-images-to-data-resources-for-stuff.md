I decided to go for the second idea. Creating new worlds (or a stuff) from various data files, for now I work just with images. An image is converted to pixels which values are rounded (decreasing number of colors) and than counted.

These numbers will create core resources to build a new things/worlds. For example blue colors can represent water, brown earth... I will also also use average image brightness etc.
