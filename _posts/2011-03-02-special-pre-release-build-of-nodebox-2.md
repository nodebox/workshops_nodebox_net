Finally, we have a version of NodeBox with undo support! You can now Command-Z all the way to the Beginning of Time.

This version is not available for the "general public" yet, but we wanted to share it to our workshop participants.Â We're releasing this to a limited number of people to see if we encounter any errors. Let us know if there are still issues with our implementation.
