Today was very frustrating for me. In a foreign land, the language barrier may be invisible, but the defecit in understanding might mean that you only get potatoes for your lunch (again), or that a simple thing like returning an item to a shop becomes a nightmare. There have been some sophisticated ideas arising from the workshop, and it's hard for me not to feel like the class idiot sometimes. One positive that came out of the morning's group presentation was that I know exactly what I need to do to complete my project. However, I've run into some problems in rendering my images in Nodebox, problems that have nothing to do with Finnish, or Nodebox. I'm missing my friends, but I'm missing my scanner more! None of these problems are insurmountable, but the end result is that sadly I have nothing worth posting here today.. hopefully, tomorrow will deliver the needed breakthroughs, and my project will properly assume its shape (it's not far off, just in insufficient resolution!). Until then, here is a page from my sketchbook, showing some (very rough) sketches of how the cards will look, compositionally, plus some symbols from my research.
