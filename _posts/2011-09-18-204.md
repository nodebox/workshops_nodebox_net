We finished working on our sprites and did some experiments with color. Right now every pokemon is depicted by their silhouette and dominant colour. We were thinking of using colour as a sign of weight, but then we would have to rethink their positions. Also we did an experiment where a chart would depict the height and weight, but then we lost values for pokemon under 0.6kg. We're considering combining these two.... somehow.
