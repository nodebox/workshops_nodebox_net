My original idea was to do some statistical visualisation based on open data from Data Hub Finland. I looked through the datasets available for download, and selected&nbsp;<a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2013-helsinki/palash/1vuosikirjataulut.zip">1vuosikirjataulut.zip</a>. Upon plotting the data from a few tables however, I realized that there were too few data points. Here are some initial experiments:&nbsp;<a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/media/2013-helsinki/initial-trials.zip">initial-trials.zip</a><br />
After this, I realised that I needed a dataset with more data-points. I went looking for one and stumbled across this dataset on Time Travel in Sci-Fi TV Shows &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aqe2P9sYhZ2ncFliSmVvb2dwRk5fcy1peHVsSDRvYnc&amp;hl=en_GB#gid=0">here</a><br /><br />Here is my WIP, and a couple of screenshots below:&nbsp;<a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/media/2013-helsinki/time-travel-00.zip">time-travel-00.zip</a><br />
