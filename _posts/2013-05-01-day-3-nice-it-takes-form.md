#Putting all ideas on paper, what a challenge.#

Today was a productive day. We started by looking all datas we had and then try to add more info to complete the portrait.

##What is the visual portrait of motor's vehicules in Canada?##

To answer this question, we did some handmade sketches and also one in lllustrator for visualize how it may look like. The result encourages us to continue!

Now we are cleaning up our datas to help us to work with them in NodeBox. It may takes a while!

More to come!
