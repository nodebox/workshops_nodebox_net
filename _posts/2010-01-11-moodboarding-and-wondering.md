<strong>Some thoughts for the workshop
<span style="font-weight: normal;">As I wasnt too sure what the theme a social type should put me to do or think, I tried to figure out what an earth it is meant to mean. By type, does it mean like typography, or other meaning, for example what kind of type of a person?.</span></strong>

I started a mind map from the second meaning. Word social I related to humans, interaction and entertainment, and the type lead me thinking directly the types of above-mentioned things.

By searching the amazing interweb I found an archive of academic journals for scholars and researchers (www.jstor.org).  Simply by searching with the title of our theme I found an article called The fool as a social type http://www.jstor.org/pss/2770893  This leads me to think the Fool, as a clown and Jester. This sounds good for the social idea of a entertainment I was thinking earlier. Generally the word social tastes little bit bitter to me, and I gladly removed the space between a and the social. So I had an idea of asocial entertainment of the bitter Jester. Just to have some weird, conflicting starting point without any sense at all.

<strong>Visual material
<span style="font-weight: normal;">I wanted to search some visual material around the mind flow to have something to inspire. Or lead me closer to understand what Im suppose to do. The same amazing interweb also offered me wide range of image material for the topic. Jester is so common and old character that I was able to find many kind of materials. Some little bit scaring and some really childish. Conventions for those all was for example clothing. Hats and jingle bells appeared to be almost in every image. Also bright colors were one common thing.</span></strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong><strong>Conclusion
<span style="font-weight: normal;">So now I start to play with same nuances and shapes as in the material I collected. From the material I can somehow probably think words or sentences if I need to. I assume we dont need to think the movement or interaction, but for that I still had idea to move components, what ever they will be, in the same way as Jester would throw balls, or other objects to entertain people. Maybe in this case he would throw something more evil and aim the audience</span></strong></strong>

Or something.
