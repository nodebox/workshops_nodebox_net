<div>We tried to find some interesting ideas for this project, and we agreed about one common subject : art in the world.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>1- most or less creative countries</div><div>First of all, we tried to find data about the number of professional artists in the world and per country. Then, with this data, we will try to calculate the rate of professional artists in the global population of the concerned country. These amounts will show differences of creativity between the countries.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>2- We can make the same approach with other kind of data related to art. For example, if data about participation in art exhibition, concert, theater act is available, we can make a data visualization about the interest of people in art or culture. Are there artistically and culturally open-minded?</div><div><br /></div><div>3 - Life and art?</div><div>Does art influence expectation of life? How does art impact the length of living ?&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>
