**IMG1 - Antwerp Location Mapping**

Map my traveling on a map of antwerp. How bigger the dots, how more popular this place is to me.

+ some more info like:

How many Km walked in a day, in a month, in 3 months.
How many Km Runned, bikedÂ… and so on.

+ compare this with my friend who also has the same data.
