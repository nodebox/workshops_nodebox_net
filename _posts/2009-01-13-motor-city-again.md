Back in Lahti and Institute of Design after successfully avoiding dangerous cars. Spending the train-trip to town yesterday led to no real improvement in the scripts I've been fumbling with, but I got a first sketchy idea:

What if one were to make a program that analyses a text fed to it, and starts sorting letters step by step into a frequency order? The letters that make up the text would be given independent behaviour; looking to make as short a move as possible next to a similar letter, until the original text is gone and all letters are grouped in order of frequency. The same could be done with words, of course. Maybe sorting them with the semantic "Wordnet"? Of course the thing should be nicely visualised, giving the letters a life of their own. I have no real idea how hard this would be to do
