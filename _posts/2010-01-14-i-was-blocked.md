No ideas, only flies made sound in my head...

I played New Super Mario Brothers (Wii console) and saw how Mario concuered obstacles by hitting them with his head.. Â  <img src="file:///Users/mikko/Desktop/Nintendo_Block_Hit_That_Brown_Shirt.jpg" alt="" />

<a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/Nintendo_Block_Hit_That_Brown_Shirt.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-230" title="Nintendo_Block_Hit_That_Brown_Shirt" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/Nintendo_Block_Hit_That_Brown_Shirt-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a>

So I tried again to hit the block that was obstructing my mind.

Result?

I try this kind of effect in NodeBox.

Maybe I hitted too hard and got that BrainCrack.... :)

This morning I thinked the wing-feather -thing and Jimi Hendrick's Little Wing started to play in my head. Music. It certainly is social thing. Oh yeah, babe.
