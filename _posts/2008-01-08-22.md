The topic was 'memes' (experimental typography).</p><p> </p><p>This year, I will mostly be investigating the Japanese written characters, looking for intuitive ways to study and visualize them for language learning. My ideal brief for this workshop follows the same path. It is called 'Augmented Kanji'. Yeah, I know. Boring.</p><p> </p><p>Not for me.</p><p> </p><p>A Mac web archive of my brief can be found here.
