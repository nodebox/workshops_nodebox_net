Following the list I made <a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/?p=362">yesterday</a>, some tryouts with text, variables, lists and the choice command:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/day6texttest1.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-686 aligncenter" title="day6texttest1" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/day6texttest1-300x192.png" alt="day6texttest1" width="300" height="192" /></a></p>

(The RandomFont.py in the NodeBox examples was of great help)

Blech I'm really starting to have doubts about my Idea. After seeing what Juhani and others have made, I feel that my stuff looks really uninteresting. I fear, that I have to do <strong>A LOT</strong> of work before my concept really starts to look interesting at all. And maybe not even then. *Sigh* well just have to keep on swimming. I really don't have time at this point to contemplate things too much. Though theoretically, if I just figure out a quick way to make something relevant and exciting visually by python, the NodeBox can do it for me in few seconds. <em>Theoretically</em> that is.
