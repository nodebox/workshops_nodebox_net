Friday evening, the end of the first week. Students learned alot about NodeBox. The first ideas already have great potential and we still have a week left. Remember the assignment: create a generative piece of art with the theme <strong>"coincidence"</strong>.Â 

Now here's a friday Lahti sunset picture. We put a picture of a sunset in Antwerp at the <a title="Antwerp sunset" href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/?p=4" target="_blank">first page</a> of this blog and we can assure you: it is NOT a coincidence! <a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/3203524189_d4a6e082ac.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-654" title="Sunset Lahti 16-1-2009" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/3203524189_d4a6e082ac.jpg" alt="Sunset Lahti 16-1-2009" width="500" height="375" /></a>
