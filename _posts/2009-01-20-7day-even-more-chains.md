How to use the vector modules?

1st line: A feedback loop.

2nd line: One grid of squares + one grid of circles = A pattern.

Rules:

1. Every module is a closed form (a "thread" loop).

2. Thus amount of path intersections increases always by two. (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10...)

3. For individual forms every other intersection with other paths is under, every other over.
