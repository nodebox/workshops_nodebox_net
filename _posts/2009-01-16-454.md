So, it's the morning of Day 5, and time for a little early morning reflection. So far the workshop has taken us to some very interesting places, by some unexpected tangents. So it is that we have somehow arrived at rotoscoped porn, jump-style in space and human broccoli. How very NodeBox! 

As Kari said yesterday, with all the possibilities of the software, it's hard to know where to begin, and how long you have left to live. Looking at my work so far, essentially a poor mock-up  of the essence of how my idea might work, produced to illustrate the idea for the other students, there is clearly a long way to go, and I had better start getting serious now! My simplistic prototype of a "Celebrity Tarot Generator" sort of works.. it just selects a specified number of celebrity faces/symbolic images from a library, then assembles them on a garish background. The problem is that at this stage, it is too random. I need to constrain some of the variables. The more pictorial elements I allow NodeBox to choose from, the more interesting the resulting image is likely to be.. but it is also more probable that one or more of these images will appear in very similar places in the composition. I need to develop a code that places the images in a more constrained, or modular fashion. For the time being, my view is only of a primordial bellybutton, with not enough distance to be able to percieve the greater whole of the cosmic torso. Let me tell you, it is not pretty.
