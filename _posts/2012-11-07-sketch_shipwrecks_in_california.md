My project works with a dataset found at Google Fusion Tables showing around 1700 records of shipwrecks at the coast of California.&nbsp;<div>I used Google Refine to sort, refine the dataset, as well as deleting records which did not have vaules for all parameters I want to use.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>I want to show all resulting entries (about 700) in relation to:&nbsp;<br /><br />1. The year they sunk&nbsp;</div><div>2. their tonage&nbsp;</div><div>3. The cause of sinking (List of several values)&nbsp;</div><div><i>(4. the year the ship was built)</i></div><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i><br /></i></div>
