i have been working on the challenge set yesterday, relating typography to that turkey/heart thing that i posted. Seeing as my point was about slow heart rate, whilst creating this typeface i was thinking about how much effort we put into saying each letter and how i can portray this. hence the reason i have tried to draw each letter as muscles of the human anatomy. as this is a preliminary idea/sketch, i went right back to Gray's Anatomy to research the basic shapes. 
After doing so, i am yet again struggling to link this to the topics that i really want to touch on within my social type poster.
I am to branch the project out into different stereotypes and use letter and picture form, in the way that i have above to create some relevant and strong imagery. `
