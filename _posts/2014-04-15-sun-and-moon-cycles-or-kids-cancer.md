So at second day I'm still deciding witch idea to continue. 
First idea is to visualize sun, moon and calendar cycles correlation patterns in many years. The other one is infographic showing recovers from kids cancer, made to look like a battle between good and bad characters. This should show that cancer is not like death sentence any more and that if we fight it can be cured.
