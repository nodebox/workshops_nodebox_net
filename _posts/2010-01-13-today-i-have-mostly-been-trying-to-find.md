Today I have mostly been trying to find some solutions in getting some data out of Facebook... and well, thanks to Facebook's ridiculously strict policies, utterly inaccessible interface and scrambled code, that came out be a dead end.

So switching to plan B: Surname Cloud.
And that means cleaning up the over 250 000 name list fit for importing to nodebox and learning some grep expressions on the side. Hopefully tomorrow I'll get into working with getting the data layed out in nodebox!
