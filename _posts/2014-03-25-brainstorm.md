## Idea 1: Mapping sites

- Find the locations of the sites I visit and visualize this on a world map.

## Idea 2: Move your life

- Vizualize where I went in six months and compare this with Yarrut Franken

## Idea 3: Switch 

See how long I stay on a site or program and how fast I switch between them.
