For our project we are interested of the UFO appearances in France, particularly in the region Rhône-Alpes and more specifically in our department : Drôme (26). We use data from the <a href="http://baseovnifrance.free.fr/index.php">Base Ovni France</a> site.

With these data we have several characteristics of these UFO appearances.

On the one hand, there are the general characteristics of the appearance such as latitude, longitude, date of observation, time, duration, weather or the number of witnesses.
And secondly, there is the characteristics of the object such as the object number, object type, size, color, brightness or the velocity.
