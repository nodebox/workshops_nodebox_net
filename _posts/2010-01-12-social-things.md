At first I started to thinking what means to be a social type. I noticed that if person is social he has to belong somewhere culture, environment. Social behavior is big part of every culture. Then I remembered an idea: if someone belongs to some culture he remembers at least one childrens poem. And usually childrens games and poems are first steps to social life.
So I think I would do funny typography. Maybe I use old childrens poems. I want my poster will be playful.
