â  We've decided to visualize the death tolls of all the nine major crusades from 1095 to 1291. Our death toll statistics will include the Christians (crusaders), Muslims and legitimate by-product of waging war (collateral damage), like Jews and pilgrims who died of diseases (seriously, how on earth 50 000 pilgrims manage to die of disease is beyond me... the Jews were mostly slain (by both sides) during sieges and other battles by the attackers ) and starvation. â
