Today, I did not continue the search for geometric shapes in the every day life, because it is really a very long job. I prefer to start using nodebox and play with these forms to see what I can do.
For now, I think rather use them in a decorative purpose. I tried last year to create a typeface with geometric shapes, I do not particularly want to re-do it immediately. Or reuse this typography. I don't know.
