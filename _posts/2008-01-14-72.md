Think about something in which you see great beauty. Why is it so fascinating? Explain that with a poster.

Thinking about a question is hard if you know that you'll have to answer it. That's why my first attempt to make a brief failed as I defined the solution instead of the task.

The brief for the brief was basically &quot;Do whatever you want and have fun&quot;. Panic. &quot;What should I do?&quot;. Wrong question. I could do anything. As I scanned throught the gallery in the NoteBox site to find inspiration, some pics made me think snowcrystals and their geometrical construction. That's the point when I decided I could make a snowflake generator.

<p style="font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Tahoma; margin: 0px">
But why? I took a few steps backwards and tried to explain what had happened in my mind before the idea of producing snowflakes was born. The only reason I found is that I just like snowflakes a lot. I've been interested in them for a long time. This is the thinking I made into my brief: choosing a topic I am fascinated about - and then again asking why.

The explanation will follow. This is the brief only.
