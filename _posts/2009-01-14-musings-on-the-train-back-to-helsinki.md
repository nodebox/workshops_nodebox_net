Todays saldo: 1# figuring out trails, at least to some extent which is bound to be quite useful 2# Getting the hang of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk">random walks</a>. They actually happen in a grid, due to the adding of integrers.  3# Toying around some more with gradients, for-loops and such.

Also learning small, useful coding bits, like abs() that returns an absolute value. There is an slightly overwhelming amount of possibilities, even though I feel surprisingly comfortable with playing around with some basic things. For instance Im looking forward to making better sense of lists and what you can do with them.

So, what would be interesting things to attempt further on? I think I must try building some simple genetic algorithm  like selecting for a string. There should be good documentation for that. This leads to one idea: perhaps to make a generator that iterates evolving patterns with different shapes? Could lead to nice results, but perhaps not much content. However, something like that would be very useful resulting for instance stuff to sell to the pattern foundry. A simple thing to do would be to re-use a hexagonal pattern I made in a randomising generator
But content-based ideas then? Data-analysis? Its bad that I dont have any good data lying around right now However: a further elaboration of idea nr 1, 12.1: Shuffling poetry  a script that re-organises a text according to the library of grammatical rules so that a new, somewhat grammatically correct nonsense is returned.
