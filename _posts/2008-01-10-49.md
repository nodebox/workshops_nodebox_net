<p>
Wind is a driving force that sets a text in motion. Wind attributes capture the mood and spirit of the text itself and their values should be defined by subjective interpretation. The character of a wind shapes the look of a text. Wind might be looked at as a textÂ’s own dramatic property.<br />
