"I wasn't expecting that", "It just happened", "I met her coincidentally", "I saw an old friend of mine. That was really a coincidence."

We're assuming things to happen. Usually coincidences are sort of surprises (in good or bad). When we meet people coincidentally, what is behind that moment. In what kind of situations, environments or at what age those meeting coincidences happen. When I go home, is it a coincidence if my wife is not there?

So, it needs two persons and a sort of movement to make coincidence happen. What happens before that? You don't find people by coincidence.
