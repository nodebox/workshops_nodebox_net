# Finally getting a shape

Lots of coffee and a short night later, our project is finally getting in shape ! Yesterday we had concentred our minds on finding a strong concept and a concrete question. So today we are focusing on «cleaning up» our datas and give them a shape in NodeBox.

Because of the monstrous amount of data, we had to sort them to be able to use them effectively in NodeBox. So we spend part of Wednesday night and Thursday on delete useless datas and resume important ones.

With a lot of trick and a big helping hand from Frederik we found a way to give our datas a shape of tree, as wanted. But we still are working on giving it the right shape for our final poster.
