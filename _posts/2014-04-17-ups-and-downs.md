So today I was trying to find best way to visualize my data. I got sun cycle (day length) in nodebox and calculated moon phase.
The best part was finding the place where sun and moon cycles align, but the numbers I got were pretty big and whole visualization becomes tiny. So I still have some things to figure out.
