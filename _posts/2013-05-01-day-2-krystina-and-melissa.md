After working multiple hours on finding the right subject we wanted to explore for this project we came to ask ourselves: How am I most likely to die at my age and from what?

We retrieved alot of information on [Open Data Canada](http://www.data.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=F9B7A1E3-1), where we have the listing of the most common deaths, by age and its percentage. These more common ways of dying vary from medical illness' to accidents. 

We will be dividing our graphic into two parts, one for men and one for women. Then, by age, we can see what are the most probable causes of death and it's percentage rate. This also permits us to compare both sexes results!
