The question is : Is France really the country of love? 

The response would be an other question : How many divorce is there in France for how many marriage in comparison with other countries? (And is it getting worst every year?)

Our problem is to find a good shape for our data to shine, that would "tell a story", while trying to avoid doing hearts. The two alliances shape seems like a good alternative.
