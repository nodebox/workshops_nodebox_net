For my masters I am interested in typography mostly in screen and web fonts. So I thinking to visualize google fonts data. Few years ago everybody was using safe web fonts like Verdana and Georgia but now everything is changed because of the web fonts. And I want to visualize what fonts are the most viewed and used in 7 days, 30 days, 90 days and 1 year time.

These are the first sketches of how visualization could look like.
