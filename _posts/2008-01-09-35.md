After thinking of all the possibilities that nodebox offers, I came to the conclussion that one of its most useful features is to create really complex diagrams in short periods of time. Basically, I thought about a project that would normally take several hours to create, but if executed in nodebox, would generate the same result, if not better, in a significantly shorter amount of time. The initial brief that I &quot;imaginged&quot; was a project in which I would create some expressive and evocative illustrations. The sollution would be to create a &quot;Pollock Generator&quot; of sorts, that would allow you to create infinite and &quot;random&quot; expressionist paintings with just one click...

But, after playing with the Pollock Generator v.1.0 that was already done...

<p>
I decided to change the brief  :(

I had to create something different, and, after hours and hours of manipulating the program, I thought about the possibilitie of creating a &quot;Kalleidoscope Generator&quot;. A sort of animation or image creator that makes hundreds of geometric images. We are creating something digital from a physical effect, something that you can create and manipulate with your hands, but turning it into something automatic, and computer-generated. Though we would remove the children's toy fact, we are managing the way of taking images out of this generator, by using nodebox, something impossible in the analog toy..

<p>
 My final sollution is an animation that plays with random sized and colored stars, that spins all over the screen and creates some kind of kalleidoscope illusions.
