Yup, started the thinking process by browsing simply google image search. I typed in the word social and got pictures of people having fun together - which didn't interest me that much. What DID caught my eye were these diagrams of social networks. Although they're (kind of) simple and rough and in no means meant to be 'art' or anything else than just diagrams, but that's exactly what got my interest. I really think it might turn to something interesting if I just move the base idea a bit further...

Another thing that popped to my mind today - or rather what popped up in my laptop's screen as I was drawing with tablet; faces. I remember reading something about how people have these 'social masks' which we change depending on the situation and the people we're associating with. I have yet to find out how to develop this to something that would work along with the assignment..but ideas are just ideas.

I guess I should do some sketching
