My workshop theme was about font popularity. In this workshop I wanted to answer the question: which fonts are the most frequent in websites? I wanted to see if websites are using safe web fonts or is it more popular to use google fonts. For this project we extracted all fonts from Top 1000 world most popular websites. In this poster you can see that all domains are on the left side and fonts are on the right.
