Welcome to Patterns of Data, a workshop held from Monday 28 February - Friday 4 March 2011 and presented by Lieven Menschaert and Frederik De Bleser.

This workshop is for designers new to NodeBox. We will learn to look at data differently, and gain insight into how to create new and interesting visualizations. We will use <a href="http://beta.nodebox.net/">NodeBox 2</a> to produce a data visualization around a self-chosen theme.
