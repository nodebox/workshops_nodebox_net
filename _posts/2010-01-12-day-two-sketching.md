<strong>Starting to produce something
</strong>My first step for the workshop was mainly browsing the amazing interweb and collecting material and some idea. Today I took pen and made sketch of the shapes from my material and I also added some texts which were related to my idea. At least in my mind.

Somehow I thought this could lead me further, some weird shapes actually will form some letters, and few of the letters I draw seems to have some characters too. Some how I have this image in my head, that I would like to have some abstract world from my starting point "the asocial entertainment of the bitter Jester". So there is few dilemmas I would like to capture to my poster.

There's also some coffee stains. It gives a thought that the whole thing could be also a little dirty and messy. Like the author.
