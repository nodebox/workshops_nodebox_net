In my experience, the term social can be expressed by simple geometric shapes. We use them every day without really realizing it. They are part of everyday life.
For example, they are very present in the signs. They are recognizable by a majority of people, fact whatever their origin.

Sometimes it seems to tell something that we can not understand. I take here the example of crop circles. These massive geometric forms, perfect, which seem to express something. One might wonder if they contain a message, or if they are merely ornamental.

A sample of all known forms: the stickers. The same that rocked our childhood. The ones we used when we did not even draw to represent the things around us.
But they exist in other forms known to all that can be found in abstract painting, for example. There has also pacman, video game superstar.
All to say that we are surrounded by geometric shapes. Scary is'nt it?
