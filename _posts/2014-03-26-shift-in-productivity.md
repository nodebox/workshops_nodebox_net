My online behavior changes a lot when I'm approaching a deadline. 
It would be nice to see how drastically my time spent on a program changes over a certain amount of time when work closes up.

A selection of **programs** (productive) and **websites** (distracting) are put in a graph were they are compared in fields of **time spent** and **days approaching deadline**. 
The programs or websites that are used most are used most are on top of the graph and vice versa. 

In the last picture you can see an exercise where I compared my acquired data of RescueTime **Time Spent** and **Productivity**.
