<strong>Background</strong><br />
<p>
<br />
In this day and age everyone wants to be a designer. But what does it
indeed take to be one? It seems that the line between true design and
amateur has become quite fuzzy.<br />
One style that is very popular at the moment is the silhouette collage
style as demonstrated by Ryan McGuiness. He has beautiful designs made
from very simple elements. But what makes his design unique? Why does his design look and feel so much more professional and &quot;designed&quot; than imitations?  As a graphic designer, I have experience in the design field but not in actual collage design.
</p>
<p>
<br />
<strong>Objectives</strong><br />
<br />
To see whether the collage style can possibly be achieved (and perhaps) more easily achieved by computer
generation but including actual input by the random person, in this case, me. To test the
boundaries of what is indeed true design and how far a non collage designer
can go. To see what makes a piece actually individual.<br />
<br />
<strong>Execution</strong><br />
<br />
Create a system in which a person (me) can make a collage by uploading some design
elements, choosing a color palette, and letting the computer do the
rest via random placement of imagery, random size, and color with some control by the user.
