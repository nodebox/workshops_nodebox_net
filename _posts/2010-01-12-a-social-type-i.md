I want to create the majority of my imagery using type. I want to convey type in an almost human way, For example I use the letter "i" show my thought process. The "i" is evoked in many social circles in life. These are social circles that we are all familiar with - e.g. family, circle of friends, romantic relationships and friendships). On a practical level, I also chose the letter "i" because of it's form, which renders the human figure in the most basic sense - e.g. the dot of the "i" resembles the human head. This is also highlighted in the main text, "a social type", in order to reiterate the idea. Other symbols, such as commas, inverted commas serve another function also. They act as speak bubbles to illustrate the interaction between the figures. Colour also plays a role in our identification of certain relationships.
