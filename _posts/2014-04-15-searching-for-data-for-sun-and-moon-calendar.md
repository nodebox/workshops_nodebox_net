I have spent some time searching for data for a sun and moon calendar and rising and setting dates and angles on horizon interesting. Also find out counting with formula may be not so easy because of fluctuations of orbits. So I'm going to test some data  visualisations to see if I can find any interesting result. I have already done quick visualisation of sunrise and sunset angles of two months.
Also I haven't forgotten kids cancer and colored some characters.
