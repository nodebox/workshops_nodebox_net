As we all know, projects always take about three times as long to complete as we expect. This predictable pattern has been born out today for me; I've made progress, but not a great deal, and with much struggle. As with yesterday, the impediment has been my unfamiliarity with Photoshop, and the seemingly randomly-assigned dpi's of various file-types. However, I have produced some core imagery for the cards, and, while the images are not perfectly masked, they look much better than what I was working with yesterday. As it's (past) time for the 4 o'clock presentation, here are some of the images thus far, arms and backgrounds coming soon!<BR>
