<strong>L-system shapes</strong>
I used L-systems for my veins and used letters from the word antihero. Conclusion expressed things like bitterness, destruction, chaos, or anything which can cause the asocial feeling. Now I can have some words in the picture, hiding but still readable if necessary.

I combined this background with the mask shape, and it just didn't work. Mask wasn't visible enough as white. I also changed the background less bright, but then it wasn't expressing light anymore, and it looked dirty. Not the way I wanted.

<strong>Veins from the nowhere<span style="font-weight: normal;">
Next I added the veins coming from outside of the canvas. Playing with the positions and angles made me think how the perspective is. Am I looking from this Jester's perspective through the mask to the world, or opposite. Either way, now there is movement from inside and from out, like more confusion. Still something wasn't how it suppose to be in the image. SoÂ <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">I had tried another idea how to add more type in illustrational way and it worked. But I will show the results when I manage to implement the idea in Nodebox. </span></strong></span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong>Summa Summarum</strong>
I'm really close to achieve my final poster, but there is quite much I need to do in the Nodebox. </span></strong></span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">And yeah, there was this funny coincidence, I was selecting music to listen to, and though I wan't to listen the band called Arcturus. And the album's name was La masquerade infernale - the infernal masquerade.</span></strong></span></strong>
