Our idea was to show a correlation between the general happiness of a country and the consummation of tree types of alcohol (beer, wine and spirits). We decided to use the data of only one year and to fill up the happiness curve of that year with the different beverages. We want to obtain a 'fluid' like visualization with different colors.
