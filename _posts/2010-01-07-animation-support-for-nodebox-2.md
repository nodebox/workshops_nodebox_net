In a few days Lucas and I will start a new NodeBox workshop. This one will be NodeBox 2 only, and so I need to make sure that the application is ready for it. I'm pushing to add animation support so our students will not only be able to make static designs, but also make things that move. Watch the video below to see it in action.
