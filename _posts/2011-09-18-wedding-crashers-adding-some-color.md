This is what we have come up with so far. On the left you can see a chart where the width of the line indicates the amount of marriages and different colors represent the order of marriage. The image on the right shows popular wedding months simply with the sizes of the ellipses. Next week we'll be developing these charts and starting to glue the pieces together for the poster.

Gettin' down on Friday
Everybody's lookin' forward to the weekend
