Still nothing too concrete, rather just ideas of what it could be. But basically...my idea is just to make a spiderweb-like "tree" which might construct of word/words or parts of the letters/words. I still need to play with NodeBox to see what it could look like or does the idea even work with it - or most important of all; will the image look like I've pictured it in my head. The sketches are rather crude and probably won't give the right idea.... Ehhh, hard to make a point when you can't see into my head.
