Our inspiration came from facebook group *Humans of Vilnius*.The idea was to collect colors from people of what they wear from pictures. We decided to separate it into four seasons: spring, summer, autumn, winter and compare it with other cities like New York, London and other. It can develope into moods of cities and compare seasons through human clothe's colors.
