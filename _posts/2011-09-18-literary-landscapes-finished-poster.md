Poster is finished and animation is in good progress.The poster creates novelist JosÃ© Saramagos Alphabet accoding to letter frequencies in the original source text from his&nbsp; book <em>Ensaio Sobre a Cegueira</em> (<em>Blindness</em>), chapter 13.

Allthough not finished, the future of this concept is looking promising with the addition of new <em>table nodes</em> - courtesy of Frederik.
