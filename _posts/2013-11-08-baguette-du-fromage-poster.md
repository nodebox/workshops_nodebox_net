Our data visualization is about the price of being French, so we took the biggest stereotype about French : They love food, and they only eat Baguette and Camembert, and drink wine. We have compared the different prices throught the years with a "cocarde" shape (which is also a stereotype symbol of French culture). This board shows how lost we were about how to represent those few data.
