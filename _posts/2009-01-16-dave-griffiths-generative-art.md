<a href="http://www.pawfal.org/dave/index.cgi?Projects">Dave Griffiths</a>' has made several interesting experimental programs with genetical algorithms, self-modifying programs etc. Quite conceptual stuff. For instance, a <a href="http://www.pawfal.org/Art/Quagmire/">program that runs with a drawing as it's memory!</a>
