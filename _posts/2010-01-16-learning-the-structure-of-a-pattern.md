<strong>Combining two simple shapes in to the pattern</strong>
As I was just messed around with my earlier sketches, I wanted to have more cleaner tryouts regarded to the pattern and grid. Besides the dirtiness of the earlier versions, they also were lacking some dynamic movement and direction. It was also little bit hard to imagine how different images are behaving in the pattern grid, what part ends where and what part will continue from where etc. I though that it's so easy to just take any sketch and throw it to the grid in Nodebox and have interesting results by luck.

Now I wanted to really understand the structure, how the movement and wholeness is changing depending of one component and it's shape. And to learn how to control it and really design instead of luck. Of course lady luck and mindless tryouts are important, but in some stage it's just good to be the commander. As you can see in the image, there is two simple parts highlighted, one is orange, and other is grey. This pair is copied with two grid-nodes.

So now I have simple template for pattern design, and it's made in Nodebox. I also managed to use the expressions in the grid-node, when I wanted to expand the already structured pattern, and not mess the positions between the components inside the pattern. If this explains something.

That's all for today.
