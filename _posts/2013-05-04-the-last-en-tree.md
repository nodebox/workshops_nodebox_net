###Poster tweaking###

Last night we finished our final tree designs for every neighbourhood. After plotting our different data sets into our tree model, we were overwhelmed by the actual visual difference between the different neighbourhoods. Our final tree models do reflect the actual characteristics of the districts and are easy to recognize. Today, we put the finishing touches to our poster in order to facilitate its understanding. We are really proud of what came out of the printer and some photos of our poster shall be posted on this blog tomorrow.
