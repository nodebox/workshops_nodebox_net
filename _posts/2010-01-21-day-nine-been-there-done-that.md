<strong>Letter explosion
<span style="font-weight: normal;">I almostÂ had the poster ready yesterday, I only needed a way how to put every piece together. I wanted letter scattered randomly around in the Nodebox, and thanks to Stefan who made this possible by creating a template for it. Image above is one part of my poster.</span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">That's all for today, tomorrow I print the final poster, finally!</span></strong>
