A group of TaiK students left for Namibia in October 2007. They participated in a workshop arranged by University of Art and Design Helsinki, University of Namibia and a local company called Woven Arts for Africa.

The purpose of the poster is to make the workshop visible to students at TaiK and deliver a message of an event that took place. Underlying thinking and question is, if there is no documentation or design product, how do we communicate that the workshop existed?

<div>
Poster should be a visual representation of the workshop conveying the positive workshop experience and interaction between the international participants.
