ok so it hasn't quite killed my mac, but i can't get it to work! this is what i have and on a pdf preview it looks very similar but it is a clipping of the whole image for some reason it crops itself. and when i try and export it to illustrate it to see if i can get anything else out of it or to format a layout it is completely different. maybe i will carry on experimenting and read up on the documentation...

GAH! i have just checked the pdf uploaded to the blog and it has done exactly what it does when i open it with another program! oh dear...
