For this week's project we'd like to experiment with different kinds of shapes consisting out of nodes and vector illustrations. We're going to try to design a serie of shapes to be able to keep on inventing new ones. It will be our main goal to create a poster that has multiple interpretations that will be given to it by the viewers themselves as we're not going to put specific data in our design. We've also provide a first (basic) sample of what we're planning on doing, you can already start trying to find out about whitch data this illustration could be...
