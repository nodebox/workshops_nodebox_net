Today, I concentrated on the display of the poster. I like what can nodebox with triangles, how they overlap. I think it's beautiful visually. For the moment I work mainly with black and white, but this may change. I can already tell that my poster will focus more on the visually than on typography.?

Here are some of my today work. Others shall arrive later.
