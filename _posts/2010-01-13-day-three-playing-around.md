<strong>Type testing from the sketch
<span style="font-weight: normal;">I tried</span> </strong>to remember that the project has maybe something to do with type, even if they would seem to be more an image that letters.

Based on the part of my sketch, I played little bit with the N. Just to see that I still remember something from the guidance of the morning. Nothing else to say right now. Luckily for everyone.
