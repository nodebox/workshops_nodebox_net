I realized that my idea didn't fit with nodebox software so I changed my mind a bit and I had to think what to hold and what to throw away. So I gave up with futuristic poster but I still wanted to convey WHAT is for us to take a coffee, that short moment that have a lot behind it. So my cup will be build by tipical italian sentences such as: " Have you heard what happend to..?", "Did you manage to..", "I think she should ..." and so on. <a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/cup.jpg"><img src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/cup-234x300.jpg" alt="" title="cup" width="234" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-587" /></a><a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/cup2.jpg"><img src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/cup2-247x300.jpg" alt="" title="cup2" width="247" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-588" /></a>

So now I'm working that it will become a real poster. I still have one entire night!
