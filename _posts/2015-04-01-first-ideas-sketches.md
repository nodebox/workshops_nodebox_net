My first idea is create universal logo generator, that could everybody use to generate a logo for his business and don't have to pay expensive graphic designers. It would use name of company as seed, so for every name there is just one variant. Additionally it could create a whole mockup. But I'm not sure if nodebox is ideal for this.

Second idea is more experimental and not very clear. I really like the theme everything is data, so I would extract from any data some information and then build something new based on them. For example new worlds. It could be nice to let people try to find ideal data to create life for example... maybe from sketch, it is more understandable.

That's all.
