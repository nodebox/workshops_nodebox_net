Here is the more or less final version of the visualization. It's a walkthrough guide to the adventure game "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_tentacle">Day of the Tentacle</a>".
data comes from one CVS (all the text) and one SVG (the blueprint of the mansion) file. <br /><br />I made the Nodebox then dynamically arrange the data to the elements, and indicate the colors to the blueprint and in the chart so that they match correctly.
<br /><br /><i>the reading of the visualization starts from the gap in the circle, and continues clockwise, line by line. each line tells reader three things: <br /></i><b>(1) which playable character does&nbsp; (2) what action and (3) where<br /></b><br />

Working with the visuals, but the idea is to use data from the walkthrough instructions of a classic 2d adventure game, and build a poster visualization out of that.<br />The main variables would be: Characters, Items, Places, Verbs. <br />The visualization would basically show at once all the choices (connections between variables) player needs to make in order to complete the game.<br /><br />
