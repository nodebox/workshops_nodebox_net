For our project we would like to create something like the images on the moodboard; string-like webs and different kind of ellipses.

We found interesting statistics about <a href="http://www.stat.fi/til/vaerak/2009/01/vaerak_2009_01_2010-09-30_tau_002_en.html">married women by duration and order of marriage</a> and we thought the string-like infographics would be good way to present that.
