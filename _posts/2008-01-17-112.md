<!--StartFragment--><p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>Design a poster</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Poster for the play Lokki</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Panu Kontkanen</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>The background</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Ryhmäteatteri is the oldest independent professional theatre group in Finland. Within its 40-year-old history Ryhmäteatteri has had numerous amount of both classics and premieres by new Finnish authors on their stage.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The play Lokki (Tshaika; The Seagull, written in 1896) by the Russian writer Anton Chekhov [Anton Tsehov in Finnish] (1860  1904) is without a doubt one of themost well-known and beloved plays throughout the history of theatre. It is generally considered to be the first one of Chekhovs four major plays. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt" class="MsoNormal"><span>The play centres on the romantic and artistic conflicts between four theatrical characters: the ingénue Nina, the fading leading lady Irina Arkadina, her son the experimental playwright Konstantin Trepylov, and the famous middlebrow story writer Trigorin.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt" class="MsoNormal"><span><em>- Wikipedia for the keyword The Seagull</em></span></p><p style="margin-left: 36pt" class="MsoNormal"><span><em>  (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seagull)</em></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>The design</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Because of both Ryhmäteatteris heritage and especially the plays nature I wanted to approach the project with certain amount of respect. And altogether, when it comes to design, I believe in strongly linear, rather minimalistic and harmonic design with a lot of rhythm to it. I also like to leave the story open for interpretation. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Because Lokki is a tragicomedy I wanted the poster to have dark, oppressive feel to it and thats why I chose to have a picture of a shore on a cloudy day as a background. The horizon is a reference to eternity  the things that happen in the play will haunt the main characters for the rest of their lives. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The water also refers to the pond whereby most of the action happens. It is also the living environment for seagulls. I decided to have the seagull in the pictureas a silhouette because of<span>  </span>the unidentifying factor and also, as we all know, black is the color for grief. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>I chose the font Edwardian Script ITC both as a reference to the past and to the setting of the play: Lokki is one of the most important classics throughout thehistory of theatre and it is very important to acknowledge and realize its historically Russian nature. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Calligraphic font is also a reference to childhood: in the play both Nina and Trepylov are taking their first steps in the world of adults.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The title Lokki is controlling the whole space being placed in the middle of the poster. It is placed by the rules of Golden section and by being placed like that it brings a lot of rhythm and harmony to the poster. The rest of the texts are placed to surround the title in a harmonic and rhythmic way. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>When choosing the colors for the texts I decided to have as a main color for the texts a color which is rather different from the images in the poster: a color with certain amount of warmth to it but yet it still had to have some coldness as well.<span> </span>I found out that red with a twist of pink feel to it worked out well. The result also functions as an effective color in the poster. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Because of its effective nature I decided to have the title in the pinkish red mentioned, and I also used the same color to point out the other two most important key factors in the poster: Ryhmäteatteri and Ensi-ilta 3.4.2008. In that way I answer the three key questions who?, what? and when?. Coloring them in the same color also points out the rhythm and harmony of the design.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Because I want to keep my designs strongly linear I decided to mention just two other important things about the play in the poster: the writer Anton Chekhov and the director Laura Jäntti. At this point I also wanted to bring out some more rhythm and harmony so I decided to color them in a different color than the other texts. Because I already had one effective color I decided to head back to the color world of the images in the poster so I chose to use black. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>The making of the poster</strong></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>When I had all the pieces together I started to work on the design with NodeBox. At first I did a rather rough miniature sketch in where I brought a background image. The second step was to bring in the title of the play. I had to find the right size, right coordinates and the right angle for the title. After calculatingthe things mentioned I placed the title in its place and worked with the color of the text. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"> </p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>After the title was ready I placed the texts Ryhmäteatteri and Ensi-ilta 3.4.2008 with the same method as when working on placing the title. The step after placing them was to place the texts Anton Tsehov and ohjaus Laura Jäntti again with the same method as earlier.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>After the texts were placed and colored correctly I continued on placing some special marks. Because of its nature the font Edwardian Script ITC doesnt have neither the letter ä nor emphasis marks for its letters I had to build them up. I did them simply by using both oval and rectangle scripts. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>After the special marks were placed I brought in the silhouette of the seagull. I had a targa image of a seagull so I was able to have the background of the image transparent in NodeBox. I placed the silhouette in its place with the same method used placing the texts. </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span>When the miniature sketch was done I simply had a new NodeBox project with the actual size for completed poster. I brought in the code of the miniature sketch and recalculated the numeral figures to get the scaling right. At this stage I also did some tweaking for the poster to get the final result more accurate. </span></p><!--EndFragment-->
