<strong>Line</strong> can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal, straight or curved, thick or thin.<br />
<strong>Shapes</strong> can be geometric or organic. Shapes are flat and can express lenght and width.<br />
<strong>Forms</strong> can express length, width and depth. Balls, cylinders, boxes and triangles are forms.<br />
<strong>Space</strong> is the area between and around objects. In visual art we can create the feeling or illusion of depth we call it space.<br />
<strong>Color</strong> has hue or its name (cyan, magentha, yellow, black etc.), value and saturation.<br />
<strong>Texture</strong> is the surface quality that can be seen or felt.<br />
<strong>Balance</strong> is the distribution of the visual weight of objects, colors, texture and space. These elements should be balanced to make a design feel stable.<br />
<strong>Emphasis</strong> catches the viewers attention.<br />
<strong>Movement</strong> makes the path that the viewers eye takes through the artwork.<br />
<strong>Pattern</strong> means repeating of some object or symbol all over the artwork.<br />
<strong>Repetition</strong> works with pattern to make the artwork seem active.<br />
<strong>Proportion</strong> is a feeling of unity when all parts relate well with each other<br />
<strong>Rhythm</strong> is organized movement in artwork.<br />
<strong>Variety</strong> is the use of several elements of design to hold the viewers attention<br />
<strong>Unity</strong> is the feeling of harmony between parts of the artwork creating a sense of completeness.
