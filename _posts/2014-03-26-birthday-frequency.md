2d idea: making a birthday calendar using my facebookdata. Every friend on the calendar is a dot that shows what year (height) and in which month (width) they were born. The bigger the dot, the more mutual friend. I might show some extra information like connect every mutual friend with lines or the busy months get bigger indicators.
