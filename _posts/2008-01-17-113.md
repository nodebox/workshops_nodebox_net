about poetry, from Wikipedia 16.1.2008<br />
<br />
Poetry (from the Greek &quot;???????&quot;, poiesis, a &quot;making&quot; or &quot;creating&quot;) is a form of art in which language is used for its aesthetic and evocative qualities in addition to, or in lieu of, its ostensible meaning. <br />
<br />
Poetry often uses particular forms and conventions to expand the literal meaning of the words, or to evoke emotional or sensual responses.<br />
<br />
Poetry's use of stylistic elements of poetic diction often leaves a poem open to multiple interpretations and creates a resonance between otherwise disparate imagesÂ—a layering of meanings, forming connections previously not perceived.<br />
<br />
Some forms of poetry are specific to particular cultures and genres, responding to the characteristics of the language in which the poet writes.<br />
<br />
Archibald MacLeish concludes his paradoxical poem, &quot;Ars Poetica,&quot; with the lines: &quot;A poem should not mean / but be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Postmodernism goes beyond modernism's emphasis on the creative role of the poet, to emphasize the role of the reader of a text, and to highlight the complex cultural web within which a poem is read.
