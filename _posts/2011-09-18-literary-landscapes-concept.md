<em>Literary Landscapes</em> is a visual essay on the relationship between language and type.

The work explores rhythm in written language, i.e. typographic variation in the novel <em>Blindness</em> by  JosÃ© Saramago. The concept aims to compare the original Portugese with English and Finnish translations of the novel revealing hidden patterns within prose text.
Work includes variables like letter frequency, word count, word lenght and sentence lenght putting emphasis on the silent changes; commas, spaces and full stops.

This concept focuses on the aesthetics of rhythm in written language but aims to find more informative ground while the work developes further.
