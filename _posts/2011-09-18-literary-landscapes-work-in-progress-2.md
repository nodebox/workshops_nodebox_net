Animation is taking form. Characters are appearing with a slight fade in effect; at least a minimal one; plus travelling on screen. NodeBox now allows to write text spontaniously.

Next step is to create a way to calculate letter frequencies without having a separate pre-calculated file and start tweaking the overall appearance of the animation and forms.
Also the scatters require a connecting piece, so that the travelling appears to flow seamlessly: the work explores rhytmic patterns in written text and connections of letters.

The typographic characters shown here are only for working purpose. Subtitles referring to the animated forms will be included at a later stage - hopefully.
