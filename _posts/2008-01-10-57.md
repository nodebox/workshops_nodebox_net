<div>
As a graphic designer you are part of the <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">visual communication process</span>. 
</div>
<div>
The <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">briefing</span> contains the content requirements of the message that the <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">sender</span> (a person, a company, an institute) wants to transfer to the target group: the <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">receiver</span> (a person, a specific demographic group etc.). 
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
The graphic designer starts with this briefing <span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">a creative process</span> that consists of three parts: the <span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">analytical phase</span>, the c<span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">reative phase</span> and the <span style="font-style: italic" class="Apple-style-span">creative production phase</span>. This is a dynamic process with only one rule: it always starts with the analytical phase whether the designer/artist wants it or not.
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
This results in &quot;<span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">a design product</span>&quot;. 
</div>
<div>
This product gets reproduced in the reproduction phase (prepress, photography, video etc) 
</div>
<div>
 
</div>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Make an analysis of this design product. What aspects, elements are needed to have a design product? What elements does it consist of? </span>
</p>
<p>
The constraint: it has to be a verbal description. 
</p>
<p>
This analysis will be used during your design process of a poster.
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
Since the briefing contains the content requirements:
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold" class="Apple-style-span">Make your own ideal briefing</span>. 
</p>
<p>
The 3 constraints you need to follow:
</p>
<p>
1: it has to be a poster (format to be agreed upon later but ASAP)
</p>
<p>
2: it has to be produced with NodeBox
</p>
<p>
3: you have to make a semantic graph of your design, covering all aspects of the design product
