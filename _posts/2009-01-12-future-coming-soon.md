Personally for me it's hard to tell any thing about node box because it's really new thing for me and it looks scary and probably hard to learn. All my life things like programs and programing stuff looked scary, but I think this workshop will change my opinion about all this kind of programing field. Nothing is impossible. I like to try new things and I hope this 2 week workshop will be very useful in future working in design field. 
I'm very exited about knowing that fact that we will be the first people who will be able to try a brand new version of node box. That's also approves the main theme of this workshop - Coincidence
