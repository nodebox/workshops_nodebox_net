New idea

I like the patterns and rastering/hatching in the banknote images. They are very much Nodebox producable.

Money is connectiong people. Look about the images of euro-banknotes -&gt; doors, walkaways and bridges. These are symbols of connection and interaction. How much our social interaction and our value is dependent of money (rethoric question... ) ?? Without money You don't have much value and You are doomed to be alone, you lousy pest!

My poster is one gigantic (A1-size) banknote. It's probably going to be just one big mess..

Äh, inhottaa jo koko aihe, mutta ei ole enää väliä! Idea sucks, but my "plenty of time" is diminishing and it would be as good as anything...

(btw. My viewpoint is intended to be critical and cynical.  )
