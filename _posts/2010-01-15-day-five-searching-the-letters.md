<strong>Give me types I'm looking for</strong>
First today I printed tryouts rom yesterday to look them a bit closer. Patterns are quite messy because they are based on the sketch, and there is lot of points in the original file. Even though I hunted some shapes from the image maze which could form a some letters, or other characters. Some parts of the patterns formed also some human shapes, but I thought I could devote this day for type. At least try to.

<strong>Antihero, hero on the wall
<span style="font-weight: normal;">Next I went back to the sketch. This time I took the whole word "antihero" and made few tests how it would behave in pattern. Cleaner version on the left is without the hand shapes, and it almost looks like nice and friendly. Almost too nice when there isn't almost any sharp shapes. </span></strong>

<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Version on the right includes also the hand parts so there is more contrast between the shapes. I rather would go in this direction, because the abstract idea behind the illustration was this antisocial person who perform and entertain people, but who is not liking that at all. So there should somehow be dilemmas and contrast and confusion and and and and...</span></strong>
