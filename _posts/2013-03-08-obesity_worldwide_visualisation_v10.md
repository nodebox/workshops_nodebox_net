This is the second version of the Obesity Visualization that I did with a Data Base you can find &nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2013/feb/19/obesity-map-of-world-weight">here</a>. This&nbsp;Doesn't&nbsp;work so well because you can't tell de difference between male and female because they overlap. Working on it!<br />
