Yesterday night, we worked late on finding the good subject to be comfortable and that has enough data to work with. This morning, after a huge overview of Node Box, we started in a team, to see what are the possibilities to work whit all the data in a graphic speech ofthe mind. 

The most obstacle were too found what we will use and what we dont in a way to clear the general idea and see what is the message behind both graphic design and data information. 

We finally decide to work tonight on different possibilities to putt information into graphics in a comprehensible ans aesthetic way. 

Tomorrow, our focus is on the graphic design research :appointment at 8 :00 in the morning to see what everybodys friendfor direction to the next step.
