I'm posting this very late since I actually drew the model above last week... My idea is that the dream diary works like an interactive mindmap rather than like a blog, as many diaries online do. I thought of this when looking at WordNet - I'd like it to be similar though visually maybe more like the black-and-white images below.

Frederik showed me websites (to me, blog-like) that could be the type of site where I'd store the information. It could also be viewed in a different format in NodeBox. I'll probably find out how this will work but right now this seems a bit puzzling!

I like the simplicity of the mindmap above.

The diary could have some visual similarity to the drawing below. It will probably be simpler, but I'd like there to be animations when moving from one word to another.
