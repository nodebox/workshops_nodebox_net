Today I have tweaked the layout and changed the color scheme totally. So now the size of the name is determined by the area of the text, instead of the point size, so the data is no longer distorted by longer names seeming bigger than short names with the equal amount. Also now the color of the name depends on the amount. This is quite redundant, but helps the most common names to pop out even more. This is further underlined by counting the value exponentially instead of linear increments, leaving a larger portion of the smaller names black.

I may still tweak the colors a little, but otherwise Im just about done here!
