### 1 
Final poster "INBOX"

The idea was to use Facebook inbox data to find out my patterns and relationships with the people I am writing to. The data is divided into two main parameters: type and quality of communication. Types are texts, links, files, emoticons etc. Quality: using curse words, compliments, good smilies, bad smilies, formal words etc. All these parameters are used to get the final scores of data.

There are three levels of information: ME (my communication), OTHER (how the other person replies) and WE (intensity of communication). From this approach I decided to create a fixed module, which is later manipulated by various data.
