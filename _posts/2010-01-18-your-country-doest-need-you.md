The weekend contained many unfinished designs on the new software that we have been learning. i found myself getting so far with a design and just having to stop from sheer confusion. I feel i have familiarized myself somewhat with aspects of them both through following my notes but my task this week is to work harder on the software itself and practice techniques when they are fresh I'm my head,

THUS. I have been concentrating on setting an idea in stone so that i have something within the project to work towards. I have concluded that i am to take on a somewhat campaign-al/decorative field, producing completely literal work in the sense that i will have a poster and that in itself is antisocial/an anti social act.

Relating back to the government and politics research, i am aiming to grab the audience in a striking and persuasive manner and decoratively campaign for anti-socialism. The strongest idea i have to accompany a subject to the theme is to create a design that encourages people NOT to vote altogether in elections.
I am still refining which demographics to target, which area of politics, which country, ethic standings etc. I know that i am unable to convince every key demographic with one poster, so i would rather get one spot on and achieve it well, all be it facetious.

What other things could you be doing in the time that it takes to place a vote? is it enough time to play three games of pool? phone a distant relative? hook up with an ex-girlfriend/boyfriend? choose, buy and try out some new underwear?
Thoughts?
