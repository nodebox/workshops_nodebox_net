I've been participating in book cover design competition for the title 'Crowdsourcing' (the competition is in Thailand) and the idea that I came up with was this cloud thought which I found it suitable to use Nodebox to create. It was may be very simple and not the whole part of the design, but it's just showing its potential in integrating itself as a useful tool for graphic designers in many levels.
