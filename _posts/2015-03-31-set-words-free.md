The main idea of my project is to let people feel a little freedom in everyday life. 

I've created geometric font, that I want to use (still just vector, minor changes are being made). It represents static and constrained everyday life.

I want to make a webpage, where people can write text (maybe inspirational quote or whatever ) and then deform text, to make it look and feel free. Then one can send it to friends via e-mail, share on facebook, or download it, and spread freedom around the world. :]
