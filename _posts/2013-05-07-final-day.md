After a week of hard work, we finally have a poster!

We had a lot of data to represent, and we were lucky that it didn't required too much cleaning time. 

we managed to represent all the values we wanted to: Inflation rate, deficit/surplus and political parties, on top of actual values of the government expenditures/revenues.

This week was great, we got destabilized and learned how to get on the path we needed to, we got to learn a new software and a new way of working with (big) data.

We can already see how NodeBox will be useful in some projects in the nearest future and it feels good to have had the chance to learn it.

We would like to thank Frederik de Bleser and Donato Ricci for this great week, for sharing their knowledge with us!
