After so much struggle and pain, we got our poster printed. Because the computer had a mind of it's own, it scaled down our poster making it smaller than supposed. Then the printer decided it doesn't fucking care anymore and printed slanted from one side to the other. In the end we managed to get a poster ready for presentation.
