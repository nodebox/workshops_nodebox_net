Well, we finally got to the future and our hands on the New Nodebox. The interface feels rather powerful and intuitive, so it's getting there For now the old coding interface still feels more transparent and intuitive though! <a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/picture-43.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-709" title="picture-43" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/picture-43.png" alt="picture-43" width="691" height="634" /></a>However, the next thing should be to get the right direction for the work with the genetic algorithm. If the problem is too well-defined and easy for the algorithm, the solution will be dull. So it would be more fascinating to give the eventual algorithm something sensible to solve. Basically the idea is to find some suitable problem that doesn't have One Right Solution, but several good solutions.
