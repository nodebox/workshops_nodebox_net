Enormous quantities of data go unused or underused today, simply because people can't visualize the quantities and relationships in it. In this workshop, we'll use <a href="http://beta.nodebox.net/">NodeBox 2</a> to explore methods for representing some data sets.

This workshop runs from 22-26 February and will result in a number of posters.

The theme hints at data visualization, so here are some of my favorite blogs on visualization:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://flowingdata.com/">FlowingData</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://infosthetics.com/">information aesthetics</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://vizualize.tumblr.com/">VIZUALIZE</a></li>
</ul>
