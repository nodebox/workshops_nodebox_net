I have couple of ideas for Local Environment app:<br />1. Blowing differently to the device will change the color (feeling) of the environment<br />2. Turning a smart phone in different angles would do the same.<br />3. A game could be made of the latter: user has a small ball and if the ball hits certain areas, weird things would happen.<br /><br />Another idea of Aalto students in different schools and departments, maybe something as in the prism example to the left<br />
