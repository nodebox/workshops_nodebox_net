October 2013 I started making a visual diary of all the things I have. Everything I buy every day becomes a sketch. Nodebox program helped me to work with all these skethes at once and categorise them by the date drawn. 

In this poster objects are colored according to week days. Therefore I found out that in weekends I mostly eat and paint (red and brown objects), wensdays are for drawing clothes (dark blue), thursdays I read books (green). Nodebox is not made to work with images, so Frederic writed a packaging node. It allows to show objects by optimised packing and not in a boring grid. 

Think inside the box or throw away everything you have.
