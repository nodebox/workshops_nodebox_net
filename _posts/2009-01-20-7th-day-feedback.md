1st image: An idea for a loop that copies, scales (2/3) and rotates (45 degrees) a circle &amp; a square 'til infinity.

2nd image: What happens when the distance of modules decreases? Here the over/under pattern is created just by cutting the bezier paths at the right points. The last variation in the series looks a bit vague done this way; the circles don't look like circles anymore. (A thin stroke is required.)
