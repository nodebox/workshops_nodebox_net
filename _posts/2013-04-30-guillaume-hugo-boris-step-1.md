The question that we want answered is: Where does the revenue of the Canadian government come from and how it is used, from 1989 to 2009 ? (Consolidated revenues and expenditures data)

The point is to see how the spending priorities of the governments (all parties included) evolved throughout this 20 years span.

For indicative purposes, we will add the inflation rate and the cost of living to compare with the evolution of the government spendings.

We took statistics from [Statistics Canada](http://www5.statcan.gc.ca/cansim/a47) and thought of some visuals that could illustrate the data most appropriately.
