Started building a concept map around the 1st draft of my brief. I'm using the Graph library in NodeBox to insert elements from my design manually, and styling them in different colors and weights according to their type. Classification was difficult. I ended up with the following ...
<div>
 
</div>
<div>
[conceptual--element--feature--description--input--memo--hilite--note]
</div>
<div>
  
</div>
<div>
I was amazed when I saw, that the algorithm automatically placed the elements on the map almost exactly like I had placed them myself, just doodling mindmaps on the paper!

I recommend trying the Graph for your own process, as well.
