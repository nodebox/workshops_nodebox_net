The concept is to develop a journey map from excel data, that maps individual schedules and compare them to each other.<br />
The map should be able to show the different time segments, ie, hours, days or weeks, distributed along its length.&nbsp;There should be horizontal lines along the length that give some idea about the tension generated on those parts of the schedule.<br />2 line map laid next to each other should be able to give a &nbsp;quick overview of clashing and busy vs flexible times of the 2 individuals.<br />Further, there should be possibility to bring out some of the text data at some 'touchpoints' along the line.<br />
So far it looks like this, with data from 2 excel sheets.<br /><br /><fieldset class="zemanta-related"><legend class="zemanta-related-title">Related articles</legend><ul class="zemanta-article-ul"><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://classroom-aid.com/2013/03/01/mapstory-wikipedia-way-of-telling-stories-on-maps-and-timelines/">MapStory - Wikipedia Way of Telling Stories on Maps and Timelines</a> (classroom-aid.com)</li><li class="zemanta-article-ul-li"><a href="http://learningwellsouth.wordpress.com/2013/03/04/how-to-visualize-in-a-good-way/">How to visualize in a good way?</a> (learningwellsouth.wordpress.com)</li></ul></fieldset>
