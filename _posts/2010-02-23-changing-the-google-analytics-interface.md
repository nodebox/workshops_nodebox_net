Google analytics is a tool made for webmasters and web designers to check their statistics. The interface google provides us does what it has to do perfectly but in a rather ugly way. Seeing that these stats are mainly visible to web designers this should be different. We want to experiment with alternative way's of showing the statistics from a design point of view and make the interface more apeeling.
