Playing around with random walks, I made a script with a star wandering around the canvas. It will get more rays and become larger if the larger a positive number one of the variables defining the random walk becomes. There are actually several stars on top of each other, which creates moiré. Which doesn't look so great in the shitty Youtube quality.
