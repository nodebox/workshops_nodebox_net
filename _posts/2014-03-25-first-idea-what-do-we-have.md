The idea is to use the data from Facebook chats to find out the patterns and relationships with the people I'm writing to. 
The data should be divided into two main parameters: type and quality of communication. 

Types can be texts, links, files, emoticons etc.
Quality: using swear words, repeating letters, what kind of links are shared, are the files sent only photos or videos as well etc.
