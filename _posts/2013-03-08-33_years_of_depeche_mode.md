I wish to represent the activity of synth pop band Depeche Mode using the following factors: -members and&nbsp; the time they were in the band - and the task they had during that time - albums and singles released&nbsp; -periods when they were on tour <br /> <br /> (My orginal wish was to represent the birth and periods of synth pop in the UK, but I do not know how to gather the data for that) <br />
