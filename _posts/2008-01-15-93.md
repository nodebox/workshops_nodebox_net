First sketch for the layout. I want the poster to look empty.
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
Text or the font are not defined yet. It's so much easier to do nothing instead of working. There's always that huge amount of shit that comes out before &quot;design&quot; and it's hard to think of it as &quot;process&quot;.
