For some reason the 'nets became unavailable for me today. The bureaucracy with Lahti's Wlan can drive one slightly crazy. Bah! So I had to wait until now to post some interesting linkey stuff that has been bumbling about in my head.

<a href="http://www.jonathanpuckey.com/">Jonathan Puckey</a> has made some rather fascinating things, especially the Delauney raster and Skycatcher wallpaper. He also has contributed to the <a href="http://www.scriptographer.com/">scriptographer</a> plugin, that puts some Nodebox-ish scripts inside illustrator.

A british artist who calls himself <a href="http://vimeo.com/defetto">defetto</a> has some neat generative music visualisations. They are rather like sketches, so therefore quite interesting to see.

<a href="http://www.universaleverything.com/project">Universal Everything</a> have made tons of neat generative stuff, etc. Inspiring  check for instance the generated <a href="http://www.universaleverything.com/205">"lovebytes" critters</a>.

<a href="http://www.download-finished.com/">Download-finished</a> is a surreal project where torrent films are distorted by plucking out keyframes so that the so-called alpha- or inbetween frames get messed up. I would love to be able to do this in a controlled fashion! Uncontrolled goes like this:<object width="425" height="350" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/zmGzFWrNpGg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/zmGzFWrNpGg" /></object>

The clip is the Betty Boop short "Minnie the Moocher", found on <a href="http://www.archive.org/index.php">archive.org</a> and subjected to some manual messing-up in photoshop using the raw-converter.

On talking of language, coincidence, and the influence of texts on hearing, this lovely video by the New York -based group <a href="http://www.thebooksmusic.com/">The Books</a> sprung to mind. <object width="425" height="350" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZHNArEfBKdc&amp;feature" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ZHNArEfBKdc&amp;feature" /></object>

Rather unrelated, but too sweet not to show is the Bjørn Svin video "Modular Noia". I have no idea whether this is manually done or created with programming.<object width="425" height="350" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/C1bG3g06iWg" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/C1bG3g06iWg" /></object>

Now for something somewhat different: strictly humour!

The Amazing Predator and Robocop Raps (lol)

<object width="425" height="350" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/ovi-djkUgd0" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/ovi-djkUgd0" /></object><object width="425" height="350" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/wUnMF7dV86k" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/wUnMF7dV86k" /></object>

And not to forget. The cream of crackpotness, the weirdest of webdesign, the epitome of inanity [Drum roll ]

<a href="http://www.kolumbus.fi/jedi.akatemia/">The finnish Jedi Academy website!</a>

Sure, it <em>might</em> be an art project, but there seem to be evidence to the contrary Note the backwards-loading "bnb images"!
