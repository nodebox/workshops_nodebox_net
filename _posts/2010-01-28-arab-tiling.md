As shown in the beginning of the workshop and also to demonstrate how easy it is to make Arab tiling in NodeBox 2. There are 2 svg files included in the zip file. The first is the perfecttriangle.svg which is the base shape of this kind of tiling (there are more). Of course from now on  you can connect anything to start with instead of these examples, try the textpath in the network. I included one svg which is inspired by the Medesa tiling in Fes, Marocco: arabcolor20. Have fun! (Remember to reconnect the svg in the import nodes).
