Today was an intense day of Nodeboxing. We were sometimes so knee-deep into the code that I had a hard time of keeping my head above the surface. And I think we will only dig deeper in the following days.

Anyways, some things I came up with:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/path.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-292" title="design1" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/path-300x300.png" alt="design1" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/path_2.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-293 aligncenter" title="design2" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/path_2-300x200.png" alt="design2" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Above: Getting to know the path command and applying Comic Sans for wows. I also made <a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/cmprpath2.mov">a video</a> out of this which could be interpreted as an <em>'from shit design to hit design'</em> time lapse movie. Can you spot the point where comic sans turns into greatness? This has a lot of random parameters, so it has something to do with the theme of workshop and the idea from yesterday of creating improbable but nice designs. Or maybe not.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Below: Trying out the Colors library, applying lists with some grids in for-loops. The colours on the grids are picked from the background image with <em>choice()</em> command.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/colortest.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-298" title="colortest1" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/colortest-300x300.jpg" alt="colortest1" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/colortest2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-299" title="colortest2" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/colortest2-300x300.png" alt="colortest2" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/colortest31.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-301" title="colortest3" src="http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/colortest31-300x300.jpg" alt="colortest3" width="300" height="300" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The Colors library seems like an powerful and interesting tool, full of potential. I really want to dig into the possibilities more deeper and I will probably use it in my final work for the workshop somehow.</p>
