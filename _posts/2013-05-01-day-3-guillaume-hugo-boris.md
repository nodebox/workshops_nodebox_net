for the third day,
we sketched a few possibilities for our visualization, and ended with a vertical stream graph type of visualization. Our time variable would go from up to down, and will cover a timespan of 20 years. 

We have two main representations : spendings and revenues, and the evolution of the deficit/surplus, causing our design to be separated in three. Over the progressing years, we decided to color separate the background in slices, to show which party was governing for each period of this 20 years. Throughout the graph, we will have an alpha variation for each inflation step.

We grouped the categories to reduce the amount of colors for our legend.
