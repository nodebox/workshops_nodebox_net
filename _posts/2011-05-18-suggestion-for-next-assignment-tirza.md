I would like to create a visualization of the main meteor showers,  visible to us on earth, taking place in 2011. Using the International  Meteor Organization's forecast data, (<a href="http://www.imo.net/calendar/2011" target="_blank">http://www.imo.net/calendar/2011</a>)  I would like to concentrate on the larger meteor showers, indicating  their peak time, density (maximum number of meteors per hour under  perfect conditions), and the location where they could be best viewed from.
