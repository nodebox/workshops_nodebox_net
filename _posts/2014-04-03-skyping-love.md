SKYPING LOVE / 
THE FLAVOUR OF CALLS IN A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP


Since I moved to Belgium, Skype became the tool to keep my long-distance relationship alive. 

But calling with Skype is also, to expand your talks longer as you would ever do by phone, it furthermore tempts to do several things in the meantime. 

The poster visualizes my skyping manners, considering the daytime (y-achse) and a certain interval of time during that I used Skype (x achse).

The color intensity evaluates the call qualities based on time I was distracted during the calls. The brighter the speech bubbles are, the less I was distracted.

An interesting continuation would be, to compare the result with other long-distance relationships. 

If interested, feel free to contact me via mail: mail@ulladeventer.de.
Thank you!
