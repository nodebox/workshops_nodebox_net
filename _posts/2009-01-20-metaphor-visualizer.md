<strong>Metaphor visualizer for NodeBox. </strong>
Behind the scene: retrieves the dream interpretation of a word and extracts the nouns from this text. Nouns that also occur in the interpretation of another word create a link between the words.

For example: <strong>love</strong> =
<em>"Dreaming of love of being in love, suggests intense feelings carried over from a waking relationship. It implies happiness and contentment with what you have and where you are in life. On the other hand, you may not be getting enough love in your daily life. We naturally long for the sense to belong and to be accepted.  Seeing a couple in love or expressing love to each other indicates much success ahead for you.  Dreaming that you are making love in public or in different places, relates to some overt sexual issue or need.  Your dream may be telling you that you need to express yourself more openly. Alternatively, it represents your perceptions about your own sexuality in the context of politic and social norms. You may be questioning your feelings about sex, marriage, love, and gender roles."</em>
