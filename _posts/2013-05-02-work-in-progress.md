So today we started building the visuals and processing all the datas into NodeBox. The datas are slowly getting into shapes. 

During the process, we noticed that most of our info about cars, and especially between the types of cars is very wide. There's a lot a difference, like an immense gap between the values of each categories, which is kind of hard to deal with. Still working on this issue.

We also looked for colour range to represent the 4 types of vehicles we're working with.
