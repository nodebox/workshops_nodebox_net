### 1 
Thinking about the information I have from Facebook inbox and about a way to visualize it. Decided to use three levels of information: ME (my communication), OTHER (how the other person replies) and WE (style and quantity of communication).
From this approach decided to create a fixed module (in the center of the image), which will be manipulated on the behalf of the relations and logic of the information.

### 2
The body of OTHER. It is constructed from four modules (head, hands, chest, six-pack), based on the type of information shared. Various combinations. 

### 3
The work begins
