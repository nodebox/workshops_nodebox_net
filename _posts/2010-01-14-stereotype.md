One of the most used sencences in Italy is "Do you want a coffee?" and we can obviously go to a bar to have it but our speciality is to have it at home, with our moka, on the table of our kitchen, proud of our kitchen! So we just sit there, talking about everything.. possibly someone else.

But having a coffee is something special in also the family in itself: breakfast, after lunch and sometimes also after dinner, and it's the moment in which almost all the family is there..tipical italian family!

So you can really hear when someone is making coffee and even if we're in a hurry, we'll find 2minutes for a coffee.

This is what I'd like to convey with my poster, the sounds, the atmosphere, the stereotype of having italian coffee.
