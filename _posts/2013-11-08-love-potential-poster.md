As designers, our main goal is to optimise the way people meet and to create perfect love stories.

We decided to test it out with our classmates. For that, we used a first name compatibility tool recognized by the scientific community. Thanks to it we created the love, friendship, sexuality and complicity matches data of all our guinea pigs. With the help of data visualization, we can now let the people know who their soulmate is.
