Yesterday I dove a little deeper into the woods, trying to get to the right mindset for coding. So all the evening I tried to find some solutions to a few problems I encountered, but even with hours of wondering around, I didn't find the right path thru the jungle of code. I already know how some things behave and some ways to effect what's happening in the code, but without a proper map I'm stuck lost in the wilderness. So I guess I'll have to rely on knowledge of my guides, to find the right path to my goal.

Here's the state where I got yesterday with the help of Frederik. The names are now packed after each other and divided into lines, not just laid on a grid. Now I just have to clean up the line endings and find a way manipulate the colors according to the first letter of the name.
