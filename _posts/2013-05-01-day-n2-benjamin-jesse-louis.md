We choose to base our research on the disasters that happened in the Canada's territory. We had a database that was pretty impressive so the challenge was to synthesized the information in a specific axis and let it tell a story by itself. This axis wasn't clear to us as a team so we had many discussions about it. At that time we hadn't a consensus yet on the visuals we explored in our sketches.
