My main theme for the social poster revolves around first encounters and relationships. Every human relationship has a beginning, so basically everything stars with hello.

I had an idea of creating patterns using typography. More specifically those tiny word that often start relationships, such as "hello", "hi", "hey" and so forth. I would like to use those patterns to create a visual form that would somehow remind you of familiarity and warmth.

My first scetch reminded me more of a carpet, but I've decided to move towards classical quilt designs. They often show a very appealing mixture of cozyness and strict geometrical patterns and shapes. Also they represent the idea of creating something whole and new out of something small and useless.

Here are a couple of quilt designs:
