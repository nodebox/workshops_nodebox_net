First idea I had was dealing with the Internet usage in the world but as I did not find appropriate csv I returned to the idea have had already for some time somewhere in the back of my head: I have always been interested how are people interconnected on facebook and how to show it visually. 500 million users would be a bit too much and this data is not freely available.Â Through <a href="http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Give_Me_My_Data">nodebox.net</a> I stumbled upon <a href="http://givememydata.com/">Give Me My Data</a> by Owen Mundy. It has already been done but I want to recreate it more aesthetically. Although, I am a bit overhelmed with almost 20k fields.
