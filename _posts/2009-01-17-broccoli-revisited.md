After discovering Frederik's face in the birch tree, we had dinner in an Italian restaurant. Frederik ordered pasta with reindeer. There was also broccoli in that dish and when he tried to make a picture... wow! The face recognition feature of his camera got triggered! I made a <a title="The broccoli proof" href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3535/3204371754_4ed411fb9c.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a> of it since else nobody would believe this.
