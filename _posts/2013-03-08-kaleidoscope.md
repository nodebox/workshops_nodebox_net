<b>6.3. Wednesday</b><br />My plan is to create a kaleidoscope image, that changes it's colors and shapes based on sound. The image could also be further manipulated by using an OSC capable device. My idea is to project the image to a wall here in the school and let the people passing by "customize" the image by walking and talking.<br />If the kaleidoscope image doesn't produce the aesthetic result I want, I can also implement the technique to other images.<br /><br /><br /><b>7.3. Thursday</b><br />Yesterday both of us tried to do a lot of different images that we could use in our final work and we did come up with few interesting things. Today we'll first continue with that and use the last hours to fine tune the "mechanics".<br />
