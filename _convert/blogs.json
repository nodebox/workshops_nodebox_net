We can immediately recognize friends and family, and can spot celebrities from meters away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Data, also has many faces. It can be represented as a boring table of facts or as a beautiful, interactive visualization. It can be irrelevant and abstract or very personal, such as a timeline of your actions on Facebook.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This workshop relates the human face to a data set of your choice. We will learn techniques that allow extracting information from pixel data and mapping data on top of faces (but also the other way around!). We'll use old-school and generative techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will use a new tool that is ideally suited for this type of work. The <a href=\"http://www.emrg.be/\">EMRG</a> in Antwerp have been developing NodeBox for a while, and we'll use the latest version, <a href=\"http://nodebox.net/\">NodeBox 2</a>, to create this project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The end result will be a portrait cabinet: a collection of portraits, each created using your own custom \"filter\".

Using a node-based user interface you get fast access to the capabilities of physical devices and external sources like Twitter or live news feeds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this master class you'll learn how to acquire data from external streams and visualize it in a relevant way. You'll learn the value of a good data visualization and how to choose an appropriate representation of your data. You can pick your own data or work with data we provide. You'll create a movie or interactive installation that can get data from external inputs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning this program also opens the road for learning more advanced software such as <a href=\"http://processing.org/\">Processing</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Composer\">Quartz Composer</a> or <a href=\"http://vvvv.org/\">VVVV</a>.</p>",

Using handles and control widgets it becomes very easy to manipulate the output produced. The data that serves as input of the visuals can be created by the users themselves or it can come from an external source, like data gathered from the internet, or from external input devices like OSC (Open Sound Control) or Kinect.
