    "body": "<div>\r\nDAY1\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nBauhaus originated theories and practices form good basis for designing. They consist of different thoughts, even dogms though most of them are based in natural facts found by research. We students might and should know these by now: colour theories, relations in compositions between forms and contrast, dynamics...The information is found in books, but at the end practise of the art is the key to understanding and remembering.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nAs a consequense a dream brief (borrowing Bauhaus teachers):\r\n</div>\r\n-Think of yourself as one of the basic particles:square, triangle, circle (As 3D particles they include hexacon, ball). Move around like one.\u00a0\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nMathematical laws can be found in the nature and the forms have perfect relations.\u00a0For sure Bauhaus movement didn't invent them so they also exist in us and our produces as ideas atleast. Ideas (perfect beings) eventually materialize if you have the right method, the sufficient guidance or knowledge of getting into the destination and the time to realize these.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nBasically with the Basic Forms anything can be designed. A font, a grid for a font, space with ambience, compositions...Use colour etc. if needed, but according to teachers at the Bauhaus: know what they might express.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nDAY3: 2 options for the project\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nOption 1:\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nA typeface generator that will generate letters on its own maybe, not by pressing buttons. The typeface is based on a grid design called &quot;Sinus&quot; (Copyrigt R. Nyk\u00e4nen) that consists of basic forms like a circle. We can see if the computer will have real messages for us through automatized generation of the letters on the grid.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe generator will have a slider through which one can control the speed of the animation. It would allow the user to set the right BPM(Beats Per Minute) for the animation if it's played with music, synchronized and used like a VJ software.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe generator works like this:\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nA) The grid appears, the design is more interesting with the grid visible. The appearing of the grid is animated perhaps, with the Sinus wave/function, since they both share the form of a perfect circle.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nB) The squarelike letter appears suddenly inside the grid. An individual letter can have several outputs/forms, but only one is presented at the time. The grid disappears leaving the letter on stage for half of the time.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nC) The letter disappears and the grid swipes through the screen again. Result is an interesting, continuous stream of letters as long as the soft runs. Perhaps we could use the typeface generator as the artistic version of the car license plate generator etc.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nPOSTER: Infomative and artistic design. We still enjoy drawing ourselves. Humans have different solutions than machines, I assume. The message: Create your own typeface or a whole family with the Sinus grid.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nOption 2:\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nUsing Nodebox as a Vj software. Output could be synchronized with music BPM. Different pitches could create different visuals, like apparently in Winamp or different mediaplayers. But apart of that creating CONTROLLERS in Nodebox allows the user IMPROVISE in counterbalance, which is the spirit of VJ:ing, I guess. Interaction.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nPOSTER: An advertisement of the new method. The poster presents the different visuals the new soft is making.\r\n</div>\r\n"

Basically, I thought about a project that would normally take several hours to create, but if executed in nodebox, would generate the same result, if not better, in a significantly shorter amount of time. The initial brief that I &quot;imaginged&quot; was a project in which I would create some expressive and evocative illustrations. The sollution would be to create a &quot;Pollock Generator&quot; of sorts, that would allow you to create infinite and &quot;random&quot; expressionist paintings with just one click...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBut, after playing with the Pollock Generator v.1.0 that was already done...\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI decided to change the brief  :( \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nI had to create something different, and, after hours and hours of manipulating the program, I thought about the possibilitie of creating a &quot;Kalleidoscope Generator&quot;. A sort of animation or image creator that makes hundreds of geometric images. We are creating something digital from a physical effect, something that you can create and manipulate with your hands, but turning it into something automatic, and computer-generated. Though we would remove the children's toy fact, we are managing the way of taking images out of this generator, by using nodebox, something impossible in the analog toy.. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n My final sollution is an animation that plays with random sized and colored stars, that spins all over the screen and creates some kind of kalleidoscope illusions.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n"

How are you?\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nWe have a new brief for you. Good timing, because you're completely broke as always, I guess. This one came up at the department meeting last week.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nOur lecturers need to help new students with understanding the Japanese written characters, the Kanji. Normally we do it by discussion, letting the people do their own research and discuss the results in a seminar. However, that approach leaves them confused .. it seems like the problem is getting an overview of what they need to memorize, in what order, and some straightforward way of making a sense out of how you are progressing.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nSo, we want to put it all in a single wall chart. A giant poster thingy, that covers the lessons and methods in the teaching material we use here. The book is called 'Remembering the Kanji' by James W. Heisig. I sent you a copy.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nThe work is huge, of course .. so we don't expect you to come up with a final solution. Do a visual prototype poster of the first 2-3 lessons in the book, and develop a design document for a NodeBox application, that expands on the same theme and makes it interactive. Keep it nice and compact, stay out of the implementation details for now.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nSo, the printed poster will contain an expanded visualization of all the Kanji in at least a single Heisig lesson, we will let you decide the content details, how, what and where.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nWe want it on the wall, and we want it both elegant and informative. It needs to be pretty, to invite rather than repel the newcomer. It also needs to be effective, to be of real help to our dedicated students. They are english speakers, around 20-40 years of age.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nWe want it as a poster first, so we can test it, and recover some of the costs by selling copies of it later. The size would be good as A1, or A2 if you must cut it down for the proto.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nGet back to me as soon as you read this, it needs to be done next week by thursday. Yeah, I know. Shit happens. But hey, we're paying you by the hour. And one more thing: no elephants in the poster. You heard me.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; min-height: 15px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\nTsup.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\n.Inoto\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Arial; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n"

    "body": "Thursday,\r\n<div>\r\nI was moving on from the analytical phase to the creative stage. Looking at the conceptual network of by brief and imagining possible solutions and ideas, modules and interfaces.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nFriday,\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nis the time to narrow down the possible options and make critical design decisions (this is the transformation stage) about what to include, where to go, and how to do it. I answered the 10 questions for the designer (by J.C.J) for each of the main elements in my design, taken from the concept graph. The outcome was a step-down list of all the features I decided to include, and also stating some things I needed to leave out.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe most important decision today was to leave out the story generator, generating memorable stories for every Kanji automatically. It is not possible to do with my resources, and goes contrary to the basic idea of mnemonics as a memory aid. The generated stories must make sense in order to be helpful. An algorithm cannot do that.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe story needs to be human. No point in trying to use the computer to create something personal.\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThis wikipedia page about mnemonics helped me to the decision.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe next stage in my process will be to build a timeline graph about the 6 steps in the Heisig method, still using the same graph tool in NodeBox..\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThat graph will be printed out, and act as a concrete checklist of the individual modules I need to write in the production stage, and the NodeBox libraries they will use. It needs to be exact, and easy to read. Onward, ho.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nAfter that, I will leave the actual production of my interactive Kanji visualization tool to wait for better days. Because, there is the poster I need to finish for this workshop. An idea dawned on me over lunch. It will have mountain plateaus from somewhere deep in China, and a foggy base, mountains reaching up beyond view. That would be suitable for an inspirational poster, but not for the brief.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nIt's funny, how the simple limitation of having a brief beforehand, and having to do a poster ...both effectively stop me from doing what I really want to do and what I value as being meaningful and important. That's the dilemma in following orders.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nI was so enthusiastic in the beginning. Imagine! Finally a workshop that just gives you time to do what you really want to do, supporting you in what are good at.\u00a0But then, limitations. Limitations assaulted me from behind, and dragged me down to the depths. Had I not learned my lesson yet? Freedom is an illusion.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n"

White background is ideal for printing.\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nA new feature is the small black type that displays the origin of all individual nodes. Very useful for knowing, which primitive is the root for the individual characters.\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nHere's a zoomed in screenshot sample from the output PDF.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nI will build 2 detailed examples of lesson graphs, and put them in as a central image of my final poster. The poster will be information graphics aimed for students of the language (according to the new poster brief I wrote yesterday), so I have a challenge in making it visually appealing with all the information and detail in there.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nMaybe forming a figure, or a recognizable shape out of the individual lesson graphs ... or illustrating/retouching the graph by including ready-made illustrations in the graph algorithm or slicing them in later by hand in Illustrator.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nI had an other idea (better, I think) about an inspirational poster, communicating both the Heisig method and the complexity and beauty of the Kanji graphs in a more concrete image, bordering on poster art. It would have Chinese mountains in it. But that wouldn't complete the brief I just wrote (dang, what a limitation ..), so I have to leave it out, or rewrite the brief again.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nBtw, rewriting the brief is an essential part of the design process, according to the Design Methods book. Because research, and the creative transformation stage almost always redefine the original goals :: revealing what should really be done to reach the goals, as opposed to what you were told to do in the brief to reach the goals. Doesn't that make sense? I think it does.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe brief should be frozen before moving on to production, of course. But that shouldn't happen too soon in the process.\r\n</div>\r\n"

Panic. &quot;What should I do?&quot;. Wrong question. I could do anything. As I scanned throught the gallery in the NoteBox site to find inspiration, some pics made me think snowcrystals and their geometrical construction.

I took a few steps backwards and tried to explain what had happened in my mind before the idea of producing snowflakes was born. The only reason I found is that I just like snowflakes a lot. I've been interested in them for a long time. This is the thinking I made into my brief: choosing a topic I am fascinated about - and then again asking why.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Tahoma; min-height: 16px; margin: 0px\">\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 13px/normal Tahoma; margin: 0px\">\r\nThe explanation will follow.

Drawing up 10 000 dots is fine, but for the poster to be really impressive I would like to draw up millions. Whenever I try this, NodeBox keels over and dies. It seems too much to calculate. I'm sure this can be solved, however.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; margin: 0px\">\r\n&nbsp;\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px\">\r\nThe second, more serious problem has to do with content: what should be visualised? If it was an interactive program it would be fine to have it non-specific, but a non-specific infographic poster is not going to move anyone.\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px\">\r\nAt this moment I don't have a really great idea for that. I will tomorrow, though.\r\n</p>\r\n"

Besides learning NodeBox I've been trying to come up with a good slogan or tagline for the text. To answer the question in my brief, in other words.\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00a0\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px\">\r\nWell, I found too many aspects...\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00b0 Mathematical symmetry because of the water molecules\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00b0 Useless beauty.

Snowflakes are a bit like butterflies, but you can think of a reason why butterflies look what they look like. Is there one for snowflakes?\r\n</p>\r\n<p style=\"font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; margin: 0px\">\r\n\u00b0 Transiency.

Then I tried to combine them but found myself in a dead-end. Math to play with? Nothing sounded right. Luckily I happened to have a great discussion with Cvijeta who gave me good feedback and some totally new viewpoints. I had concentrated in words and language and forgotten to think visually (A picture worth of thousand words, I know...). Cvijeta proposed that I could make the poster by embossing the illustartions instead of printing. A wonderful idea, that gave me a brand new visual idea. See the scetches on next posts.\r\n</p>\r\n"

Within its 40-year-old history Ryhm\u00e4teatteri has had numerous amount of both classics and premieres by new Finnish authors on their stage.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The play \u0093Lokki\u0094 (Tshaika; The Seagull, written in 1896) by the Russian writer Anton Chekhov [Anton Tsehov in Finnish] (1860 \u0096 1904) is without a doubt one of themost well-known and beloved plays throughout the history of theatre. It is generally considered to be the first one of Chekhov\u0092s four major plays. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 36pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u0093The play centres on the romantic and artistic conflicts between four theatrical characters: the ing\u00e9nue Nina, the fading leading lady Irina Arkadina, her son the experimental playwright Konstantin Trepylov, and the famous middlebrow story writer Trigorin.\u0094</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 36pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><em>- Wikipedia for the keyword \u0091The Seagull\u0092</em></span></p><p style=\"margin-left: 36pt\" class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><em>\u00a0\u00a0(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seagull)</em></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><strong>The design</strong></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Because of both Ryhm\u00e4teatteri\u0092s heritage and especially the play\u0092s nature I wanted to approach the project with certain amount of respect. And altogether, when it comes to design, I believe in strongly linear, rather minimalistic and harmonic design with a lot of rhythm to it. I also like to leave the story open for interpretation. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Because \u0093Lokki\u0094 is a tragicomedy I wanted the poster to have dark, oppressive feel to it and that\u0092s why I chose to have a picture of a shore on a cloudy day as a background. The horizon is a reference to eternity \u0096 the things that happen in the play will haunt the main characters for the rest of their lives. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The water also refers to the pond whereby most of the action happens. It is also the living environment for seagulls. I decided to have the seagull in the pictureas a silhouette because of<span>\u00a0 </span>the unidentifying factor and also, as we all know, black is the color for grief. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>I chose the font \u0093Edwardian Script ITC\u0094 both as a reference to the past and to the setting of the play: \u0093Lokki\u0094 is one of the most important classics throughout thehistory of theatre and it is very important to acknowledge and realize its historically Russian nature. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Calligraphic font is also a reference to childhood: in the play both Nina and Trepylov are taking their first steps in the world of adults.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>The title \u0091Lokki\u0092 is controlling the whole space being placed in the middle of the poster. It is placed by the rules of Golden section and by being placed like that it brings a lot of rhythm and harmony to the poster. The rest of the texts are placed to surround the title in a harmonic and rhythmic way. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>When choosing the colors for the texts I decided to have as a main color for the texts a color which is rather different from the images in the poster: a color with certain amount of warmth to it but yet it still had to have some coldness as well.<span>\u00a0</span>I found out that red with a twist of pink feel to it worked out well. The result also functions as an effective color in the poster. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Because of its effective nature I decided to have the title in the pinkish red mentioned, and I also used the same color to point out the other two most important key factors in the poster: \u0091Ryhm\u00e4teatteri\u0092 and \u0091Ensi-ilta 3.4.2008\u0092. In that way I answer the three key questions \u0093who?\u0094, \u0093what?\u0094 and \u0093when?\u0094. Coloring them in the same color also points out the rhythm and harmony of the design.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Because I want to keep my designs strongly linear I decided to mention just two other important things about the play in the poster: the writer Anton Chekhov and the director Laura J\u00e4ntti. At this point I also wanted to bring out some more rhythm and harmony so I decided to color them in a different color than the other texts. Because I already had one effective color I decided to head back to the color world of the images in the poster so I chose to use black. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span><strong>The making of the poster</strong></span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>When I had all the pieces together I started to work on the design with NodeBox. At first I did a rather rough miniature sketch in where I brought a background image. The second step was to bring in the title of the play. I had to find the right size, right coordinates and the right angle for the title. After calculatingthe things mentioned I placed the title in its place and worked with the color of the text. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\">\u00a0</p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>After the title was ready I placed the texts \u0091Ryhm\u00e4teatteri\u0092 and \u0091Ensi-ilta 3.4.2008\u0092 with the same method as when working on placing the title. The step after placing them was to place the texts \u0091Anton Tsehov\u0092 and \u0091ohjaus Laura J\u00e4ntti\u0092 again with the same method as earlier.</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>After the texts were placed and colored correctly I continued on placing some special marks. Because of its nature the font \u0093Edwardian Script ITC\u0094 doesn\u0092t have neither the letter \u0091\u00e4\u0092 nor emphasis marks for its letters I had to build them up. I did them simply by using both oval and rectangle scripts. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>After the special marks were placed I brought in the silhouette of the seagull. I had a targa image of a seagull so I was able to have the background of the image transparent in NodeBox. I placed the silhouette in its place with the same method used placing the texts. </span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>\u00a0</span></p><p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>When the miniature sketch was done I simply had a new NodeBox project with the actual size for completed poster. I brought in the code of the miniature sketch and recalculated the numeral figures to get the scaling right. At this stage I also did some tweaking for the poster to get the final result more accurate.\u00a0</span></p><!--EndFragment-->"

I was lucky Lucas gave us an extra 30 minutes: I created the entire poster in InDesign during that slack. Fonts are not carefully thought out, layout came out of the pipe, image was the first hit on google with the keyword 'chinese mountains' and I have no idea who controls the copyright. Sorry for stealing. If this ends up in the workshop exhibition, I will have to replace the picture with something else. But in the end, the final poster design was completely controlled by the actual content images from the NodeBox scripts, their sizes and respective order is all defined by the inputs and the algorithms. I could say, that in the end, my final brief designed the visuals for the poster, not me. And that's how it should be, in a way. Automation rocks?\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n...\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nSecond time in this ws, I would attend a third time, as well. I like the software, and how quick it is for prototyping. The original brief was buillding an interactive app, taking you through the Kanji visualization steps in the method step-by-step, and speaking out the keywords through the system synth. I almost got there, but building the Kanji database was out of the question during these weeks, even for the first 2 lessons like I originally planned. Next step for me is to clean up the code, pull some of that shit together and build a gizmo for building new graphs out of a Heisig index number.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe lesson graphs made with the Graph library in nodebox work fine as a wall sheet, I believe. They are good for taking notes, drawing doodles and keeping track of where you are in the review stages. The graph needs some subclustering, so the related kanji will stick together more closely.\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe lesson graph, I guess, will be the tool that will help me the most in learning the Kanji after this workshop. Motivation was high because stakes were high. Studying the Kanji is a learning task that really benefits from good study materials.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n..\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nNothing more to say for now about this information graphics experiment. If you're interested in the method or the lesson graphs, drop me a line at\u00a0\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nfirst name.last name taik.fi.\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n"

At the same time I wanted to bring in a new and fresh approach for a local (Namibian)  traditional crafts.\r\nRandom is a word I would describe my implementation idea for the poster. I wanted to make a &quot;Poster Generator&quot; that makes a new kind of poster everytime.\u00a0\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe root idea was to choose a square shaped area of each of the photographs for the poster in a random manner. Random means experimental and abstract.\u00a0I wanted to have a bit of a new approach to manual crafts. You need to get close to see what is happening in the photographs. At an ultimate and the most preferable situation, there will be several posters presented in co-existance. The photographs will only tell a short story but with several posters seen at the same time they tell a long story.\u00a0 \r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\nThe texts are rotated to emphasize motion. Texts I spesified different sizes and colors for the fonts to vary in, so the randomness is controlled still.\r\n</div>\r\nThe only tool used in designing and producing the poster should be Nodebox."

    "body": "De laatste post, een emotioneel moment voor ons allemaal..<div>Er zijn nog heel wat aanpassingen uitgevoerd voor de laatste versie van ons design. Zo zijn de variabele brillen verwijderd, wegens het te druk worden van het geheel. Het aantal amoebes is ook toegenomen, maar daarover later meer. Door die toename bleken enkele strokes ook niet meer in verhouding. We hebben deze dan smaller gemaakt. Daarnaast hadden we nog een probleem met de variabele kleuren van de amoebes. Die functie hadden we al wel geschreven, maar nog niet in werking gesteld, om rendertijd te besparen. Het probleem bestond eruit dat we een Color Node hadden gebruikt, waaruit alle generators (van vormen binnen in de amoebe en de amoebe zelf) hun variabelen putten voor de kleur. Die variabelen werden echter pas gevormd in de laatste Place node. Daardoor moesten we eigenlijk de Color node met variabelen eigenlijk in het netwerk includen, maar daarop was ons netwerk niet berekend. We hebben het uiteindelijk opgelost door de generators naar elkaar te verwijzen, en de eerste generator rechtstreeks de variabelen van de laatste Place node te laten halen.</div><div><br /><div>Na heel wat renderproblemen hebben we het (dankzij de hulp van de docenten) met een toevoeging onze amoebe-snus met heel veel amoebes toch kunnen renderen. De volgende regels code hebben hier mede voor gezorgd. Ze bieden een oplossing voor het infinity probleem.</div><div><br /></div><div>try:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p = supershape.path(x, y, w, h, m, n1, n2, n3)</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; p.fillColor = self.color</div><div>except:</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return None</div><div><br /></div><div>Een 600 tal amoebes renderen behoorde plots tot de mogelijkheden.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ondertussen kregen we het idee om voor het posterdesign een achtergrond, neus en deel van een bril toe te voegen. Deze hebben we in Illustrator gemaakt en nadat de amoebe-snor in pdf&nbsp;ge\u00c3\u00abxporteerd&nbsp;was konden we alles samenvoegen.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Bij het exporteren van het geheel hadden we nog een probleem: de kleuren die vanuit Illustrator naar Photoshop waren doorgevoerd bleken niet CMYK compatible te zijn. De afbeelding in Photoshop zag er veel minder goed uit. We hebben uiteindelijk de Photoshop afbeelding toch maar in RGB gezet, en gehoopt dat de uiteindelijk print niet te ver ging afwijken van de oorspronkelijke afbeelding.</div><div><br /></div><div>En toen was het klaar, iedereen was gelukkig, en het project won.</div><div>Groetjes,</div><div>Joren en Paul</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Extraatje:</div><div>Een lijst met variabelen:</div><div><br /></div><div>Amoebe - lichaam:</div><div>Grootte</div><div>Vorm</div><div>Kleur</div><div>Textuur (patronen+vlekken binnen)</div><div>Kleur Textuur</div><div><br /></div><div>Amoebe - tanden:</div><div>Aantal</div><div>Grootte</div><div>Startpunt</div><div><br /></div><div>Amoebe - Snorren:</div><div>Vorm</div><div>Positie op Amoebe</div><div><br /></div><div>Amoebe - Ogen:</div><div>Positie op Amoebe</div><div>Kijkrichting</div><div>Grootte</div><div>Aantal (2-4)</div><div><br /></div><div>Totaal snor:</div><div>Positie amoebes</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>"

Deze UFO's zouden ook verschillen moeten vertonen, maar uiteraard ziet een ufo er uit als een ufo. De verschillen bestaan dus uit de richting waar het kanon naar wijst. Bovendien zorgde serendipiteit er nog voor dat de shuttle zelf minimale verschillen vertoonde naarmate de richting waar het kanon naar wijst. Tenslotte heb ik ervoor gezorgd dat ufo's verschillende afmetingen zouden hebben en dat kleinere ufo's donkerder zouden zijn dan ufo's die groter waren. Dit met als doel een betere dieptezicht te verkrijgen. <br />Ook heb ik gezorgd voor een achtergrond gevuld met sterretjes van verschillende afmetingen.&nbsp; <br /> "

Op verzoek werd me de database toegestuurd, waardoor ik ineens een mooie set met bruikbare gegevens had. Ik wilde dat niet alleen doen vanwege de oefening: het visualiseren van de data, ik wilde dat ook doen omwille van de toepassing van het resultaat. In mijn ogen zou het een welkome aanvulling op de bestaande resultaten en conclusies kunnen zijn.<div><br /></div><div>Het mooiste aan de dataset was dat het 1195 ondervraagden bevatte, waardoor er dat aantal unieke combinaties aanwezig waren. Iedere student had namelijk zijn eigen loopbaan binnen de school gekend, met dito keuzes en resultaten. Met andere woorden: het leek me een uitdaging om die route te visualiseren, waardoor er automatisch patronen zouden ontstaan. Het zou uitermate geschikt moeten zijn om snel een inzicht te krijgen in populaire studierichtingen, de meest behaalde slagingspercentages, etc.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Ik had al snel in mijn hoofd hoe ik het wilde visualiseren (zie schets). Hoe ik dat zou moeten maken in Nodebox, dat was een heel andere vraag. Gelukkig bleek het gemakkelijker dan verwacht te zijn, waardoor het samenstellen relatief vlot ging (uiteraard met de nodige momenten waarop begeleiding onmisbaar bleek). Ik wilde graag een lijnenconstructie maken, waarbij elke lijn een ondervraagde ex-student bedroeg. Deze lijn zou dan van keuze(-optie) naar keuze(-optie) lopen. De gehele route, van boven naar beneden, zou dan ongeveer het parcours zijn dat de student destijds op school had doorlopen, met een toevoeging van de sector waarin hij of zij nu werkzaam is.</div><div><br /></div><div>Het geheel laat een zowel een grote complexiteit zien (elke afzonderlijke lijn) als een grote homogeniteit (de gelijklopende routes / keuzes). Het is daarom, in mijn optiek, een heel bruikbaar document geworden. Jammergenoeg had ik geen tijd meer om er op een gesofisticeerde manier (d.w.z.: met de intelligentie van Nodebox) kleur aan toe te voegen.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div>"

The things you can do with nodebox blow my mind but at the same time lift the bar of design really high. And I have a bad habit of trying too much. But, this time I am focused on restraining myself from falling into desperation. And also, the new features in nodebox interface should make the designing more easy and fun.\r\n\r\nFrederik demoed the new interface to us a bit. It will be more close your \"normal\" mac-user friendly <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG\">WYSIWYG</a> enviroments (me thinks): You can see and edit the \"nodes\" or blocks of code more in real time.

Of the several small experiments I've been toying around with, none have much in the way of content. It would be interesting to try out something data-based rather than purely visual, but on the other hand it is more than useful to learn different ways of working with programming.

    "body": "I don't know if coincidence is a word to describe how I ended up attending this workshop. I experience coincidences all the time, and look for connections. Initially I thought I might not personally be interested in using nodebox because I had gotten the impression that this would be two weeks of coding typography. I it might change someday since many things have, but so far it's been impossible to sit still at a computer doing something like that. I prefer drawing by hand to doing things by computer, and usually I at least start working by writing and doodling in my notebooks.\r\nI have no problem, however, spending all day on the computer chatting, reading and writing emails, watching videos, reading blogs and following links ending up looking at something totally different than what I started with. That seems worthwhile (although it isn't always), a journey, something where you can discover and learn about people, the world, yourself. Though I have specific interests and make choices, I can't know how big my effect in the world is. I often let things happen, giving many things a try out of curiosity.\r\n\r\nSo I came to listen what this workshop (I just misspelled it 'workship', which somehow pleases me because of the association to traveling, a journey, and the fact that I can't only drift but might in fact have to work really hard to produce something) is about, and it blew my mind - what I saw and heard about previous things made with nodebox opened so many possibilities and questions. (By the way, I love the plastic bag story!) I like it how the makers and users of nodebox make models of how biological and social phenomena work, often based on scientists' research. There seems to be both systematic and intuitive research and searching going on. I got the impression that there's constant change in the program and its uses. The database of words, ideas, concepts and thoughts need to be made wider - I hope lots of people will be able to take part in developing that, it's got potential to be a very interesting tool.\r\nThe random art criticism text generator cracked me up. Those kinds of formulae are refreshing, anything that seems to question norms and hierarchies, play with our conceptions and worldviews. At the same time it also made me feel awkward because it seems to mock anyone writing in a complex way. I find it funny though that people look up to authors of texts they don't understand. Some texts are complicated for a good reason though; to be expressed accurately, things shouldn't be oversimplified. The fact that people randomly create something, whether text or art that's looks like there's a lot behind it seems to undermine the purpose of it - expression is difficult, uncertain and vague enough without that. People can always find meanings that weren't meant to be expressed though, which can be good for them, perhaps not so good to those who try to say something specific!\r\nI love playing with ideas and communication though. And that's what seems to be behind this - playing with common assumptions and blurring boundaries. Also, since I make art intuitively, I wonder what the connection between a human's intuition and different models of it are. There are questions on my mind about how to look at language, expression, communication.\r\n\r\nI still have no idea what I'm going to do. Both my thoughts and text are drifting in all directions. I didn't have much of a clue how I could make a computer do the things saw today - perhaps it will be easier to understand once I've tried out the program. So glad there'll be a new version! I'd like to find a way to make animations that doesn't require too much coding...\r\n\r\nI find everything related to music fascinating. Today, we saw some visuals that reacted to music. I'm interested in connections between things and the concepts behind them. I wonder where the border between sounds or noise and music is, and how preferences for these come about. People seem to have very distinct tastes in music.\r\n\r\nI need to think of something specific to work on. I'm sure thoughts will come together but suggestions are welcome!"

The possibility of using data from internet resources like Wikipedia &amp; Google image search etc. made me curious. The nodebox script that \"translated\" (abstract) words into colour schemes was interesting. I don't know though if I should take it as some cultural revelation or something that just banalizes the experience of colors. Perhaps I have some false belief about the uniqueness of my personal experience relating to colors? Google image search is similar in the way it returns hierarchical results. There is always some image above others, an \"objective\" best match. The search creates bonds between words and images. (Yet the image is not selected for what it really is, visual data, but rather for the text content that surrounds it.) Anyone typing the same word gets the same result, which strengthens the connection (the coincidence of word &amp; image). Doesn't this ultimately result in a permanentally coincidental meaning between the word &amp; the image? The word refers to the image and vice versa, creating some sort of absurd global hieroglyph. Things, people, activities, localities, emotions, ideas etc. can be represented in one arbitrary jpeg image. Could the search process be done differently, inverted somehow? Maybe an image could be used as the input for collecting text data? Also, it could be interesting to search for images based on some other images' color schemes or contrast patterns, for example. (That is images for in- and output.) Would it be possible to search audio data by other audio data, or image data by audio data? Or image data by text data by audio data by video data etc...Maybe create some infinite loop inside and between search engines that is in constant metamorphosis?"

I don't feel so worried about this yet. Today was only our first day, we have a whole week of Nodeboxing ahead and then a luxurious second week of time to finish our designs.

Also, I've heard somebody making the claim, that conspiracy theorist are usually the ones who not only <em>believe</em> in them but subconsciously <em>want</em> the conspiracies to be true. To many it is lot easier and soothing to know that there is some logic in all this, some great design. Believe you in conspiracies, god, fate, luck, or coincidences \u0096 for that matter \u0096 it is always matter of subjective belief.

Input normal text \u0096 output text will look make conspiracy theorist jump in the air with exciment (god this sounds boring as I'm writing it).\r\n\r\nOR it could do the same with images.\r\n\r\n\r\n2) <strong>Infinite improbability design drive</strong> after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Improbability_Drive#Infinite_Improbability_Drive\">one in Douglas Adam's books</a> only this would try to make great design by the most improbable way. Eg. Win a design competition with only using comic sans.\r\n\r\nTo be continued..."

Are these analogies only impediments, an intermediary phase before some new tools that are more characteristic of the computer itself? Isn't it quite natural to imitate physical tools? It's impossible to completely detach one's self from the concrete world. The computer itself ultimately presents the end-product in a concrete form, something that can be seen (light).\r\n\r\nAccidentally, my first experiments in Nodebox turned into optical illusions. Two \"stars\" placed on top of each other resulted in moire patterns. Paradoxically, moire forms are something that are independent of the geometric forms that are in question (two stars in this case). The code is exact and very minimal but just the act of looking at the images produced by the code adds elements to the whole, something that doesn't really exist. The concrete forms (as opposed to the forms as programmed abstractions) are surprisingly different and pretty unpredictable (at least for me).\r\n\r\nA quicktime clip: starmove2yy.mov\r\n\r\n"

Lucas mentioned food packaging design that references the product itself in the cover, which instantly creates an infinite loop of images.

I usually take to computer programs like a duck to a glacier (it might have been noticed that it's taken me this long just to log in to this blog succesfully!), but this software seems very interesting, and full of possibilities. </span>\r\n\r\n<span lang=\"EN\">I study illustration at my home institution in the UK, and the current project there is focusing on narrative - my intended specialisation, so I\u0092d been hoping to try to relate to this in my work here. My work stems from my sketchbook doodles.. I try to allow the right side of my brain more say in what I am drawing than the left. This often produces drawings which are a surprise to me, but which also contain some deep-set symbolic significance.\u00a0I saw this\u00a0particularly clearly recently, while\u00a0making a large collage from various photocopied pages of my sketchbooks .. I began to see connections between images which I had previously considered \u0093meaningless\u0094, and the whole piece took on a narrative life which had previously been invisible, much as NodeBox makes some of its quasi-synaptic connections. The collage was finished with a quote that I found in a book on the shelf by the library photocopier, while I waited for my turn, which made mention of Bournemouth (my hometown, where the piece would be exhibited, but in this case the name of a scholar) and a disbelief in the spirit world (the theme of the collage). Quite an amazing coincidence? Or is it just that the photocopiers happen to be by the Religion section, and this is the area where I would be most interested to look? I suspect that this is the actuality of most \u0093coincidences\u0094.. an unconscious bias or influence creates these connections. The experience of making this collage made me think about all this,\u00a0and also another ongoing interest -\u00a0tarot cards.. how they can function as a visual lexicon, supplying archetypal elements from which the users can build their own narrative. No coincidences, but an engine to create connections between our personal situations and our symbolic world, the function of stories since time untold. So, I had been thinking about a way to present a visual narrative in this fashion, based on a randomised selection of archetypal story elements. Is it a coincidence that I now find myself in Lahti, learning a software seemingly perfectly suited to this idea? Or is that just New Age fluffy thinking? Was Philip K. Dick in his right mind or his wrong mind when he claimed that language is an organic system? And will I find my way back to the right classroom tomorrow? </span>\r\n\r\n<span lang=\"EN\">I'm not sure! But what today's lesson did confirm is that my idea does seem very possible, though I think I might need to set myself a goal that is more realistically achievable than an in-depth generative application based on tarot.. perhaps a program that generates 'visual horoscopes', as much open to interpretation as the written version, but based on broader visual associations. And perhaps with more overtly modern\u00a0instances of classic archetypes - Celebrity Tarot anyone? </span>"

Is it SEX? What if I told you that it is SFX, you dirty-mind? Or maybe it doesn't \"read\" anything at all.\r\n\r\nRecalling what we have talked about in the workshop regarding conspiracies: 1) People who believe in them tend to see only the facts backing the conspiracy theory and dismissing the other; 2) Usually you have to hear about a conspiracy before you can see it anywhere, rarely people stumble across them; 3) If you look for signs of a conspiracy you <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias\">begin to see them everywhere</a>.\r\n\r\nDoes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity\">synchronicity</a> exist or is everything just a coincidence? Do things in nature have pretermined logic to them that we can measure? The golden ratio or Fibonacci series seems like an undeniable evidence of a logic in nature but is it possible to interpret these \"signs\" correctly? I mean the idea of \"mathematics\" or \"logic\" as we think of them was conceived by us humans initially. Maybe we have got it all wrong. If you search for a god you will find \"the <em>divine</em> ratio\" eventually.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think that things like conspiracies are immensily interesting, but at the same time I acknowledge that it is my desire for the world to be more interesting place and to have some meaning. It's really fun to think that they are true, but it doesn't mean that they are.\r\n\r\nFrederik told us about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_reading\">cold reading</a> and it's fascinating how close the examples of that resembled my thoughts on conspiracies. Our mind sees and hears things there that necessary aren't there, like the Lucas' example of songs played backwards making sense only after you have read the lyrics for them.\r\n\r\nFor some reason especially dirty jokes and sexual connotations are something you want to spot everywhere. What would Freud say about this:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><object width=\"425\" height=\"350\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/BQ_l-x_d5EQ\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/BQ_l-x_d5EQ\" /></object>\r\n\r\nThe <strong>Conspiracitor</strong> would look through an image and draw a pattern or a shape on top of it based on similarity in color values of pixels, but mostly randomness. Before I thought that the application could actually search the picture for a mathematical logical pattern (like a pentagram) in pictures based on color values, but I've realised that it would either extremely hard or impossible to produce as the way computer thinks is really different from humans. However, one wouldn't need to think about that if you would implement some cold reading techniques:\r\n\r\nSay, after it draws the pattern it would ask: \"Is there a <em>beach-ball </em>in this picture?\" and you would be amazed because it would look like a beach ball, or a ball, or a circle or something close to that . This could be made more accurate if there would be a list of words that match to simple shapes. The computer would be told: \"after analysing the picture and retrieving the order and color values of the pixels in the picture, if you find everything that forms a familiar pattern (insert math functions of shapes), draw that pattern creating (x) number of points in the coordinates of those pixels. Then retrieve a random name from a list of (for instance) circle-shaped objects (ball,baseball, sun...)\".\r\n\r\nThen again this wouldn't be even necessaary. The power of the associating human mind, like cold reading proves, would probably \"fill in the blanks\" of every random claim.\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><object width=\"425\" height=\"350\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ylZrx6pwugE&amp;feature\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/ylZrx6pwugE&amp;feature\" /></object>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">......</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I also had another idea but as the clock is closing to 03:00 am and I'm starting to pass out I will have to lay it out really quickly:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Idea 2 - Brand new!:</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Ingrishsizer</strong> - Ever wondered how the <a href=\"http://www.engrish.com/\">japanese do it</a>?

Nodebox would then reorganize the word order, add spelling mistakes and noise to the kerning of the letters and for instance randomly scale their widht. But only so much, that it would still remain comprehensible to some amount.

Signage would consist of fonts that are more traditional and would add less noise of scaling or kerning. It would also add a picture from a library of information graphics. It could also randomly at fonts from a japanese typeface, if wanted, to underline the joke. T-shirt prints would use a wider range of fonts and constist of less words, but with more randomness and unlikeliness to them + it would add effects to the text and design elements from a large library of stuff. Yay! Endless fun.</p>\r\n\r\n[gallery]"

    "body": "What next? Some thoughts about a potential concept...\r\n\r\nI've enjoyed trying out different things with Nodebox, though mostly the results have been completely accidental. Because of this I've found it difficult to continue with these experiments much further. At the moment I'd like to do something connected to my \"ordinary\" book typography related work (more conservative in nature), but also to look for something that is visually interesting, somewhat experimental, and most importantly characteristic of the tool being used (nodebox or computers in general).\r\n\r\nI came to think of ornaments that are used in traditional book typography: growing plants, knot-like forms, calligraphic/geometric patterns \u0096 things that are at the same time rational, geometric, disciplined, but also unpredictable, spontaneous, exuberant, imaginative &amp; associative (letters and empty space suggest different ornamental forms). Ornaments should be considered the last elements in the hierarchy of all the visual elements of books: 1st is the empty page and its proportions, 2ndly the primary mass of text, 3rd headlines, drop caps etc. and then ornament which is partly defined by what exists already.\r\n\r\nMy concept at the moment is to do \"generative\" ornaments, as imitation of traditional forms of ornament, at the same time maybe increasing complexity by layering groups of forms (\"modules\") or by repetition of forms in big numbers or by using self-referencing forms. (Perhaps also some randomness?)\r\n\r\nI collected a few historical &amp; modern examples...

What I think is crazy is that they didn't use a computer to generate the black ink lines of the characters but painted them by hand to every frame. In a documentary about A Scanner Darkly, it said that they had almost double the amount of time for production compared to \"normal\" films: first they shot the scenes with live actors on set as you would in any movie, then they used the same amount time (if not more) for rotoscoping the scenes.\r\n\r\nHere's a clip from <em>Waking life</em>:\r\n\r\n<object width=\"425\" height=\"350\" data=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/_qc71nMr3BU\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube.com/v/_qc71nMr3BU\" /></object>\r\n\r\n*Sigh* According to the blog, it seems today was efficiently used as I've mostly posted youtube links.\r\n\r\nWell, a new day brings new discoveries.

So it is that we have somehow arrived at rotoscoped porn, jump-style in space and human broccoli. How very NodeBox!\u00a0\r\n\r\nAs Kari said yesterday, with all the possibilities of the software, it's hard to know where to begin, and how long you have left to live. Looking at my work so far, essentially a poor mock-up \u00a0of the essence of how my idea might work, produced to illustrate the idea for the other students, there is clearly a long way to go, and I had better start getting serious now! My simplistic prototype of a \"Celebrity Tarot Generator\" sort of works.. it just selects a specified number of celebrity faces/symbolic images from a library, then assembles them on a garish background. The problem is that at this stage, it is too random. I need to constrain some of the variables. The more pictorial elements I allow NodeBox to choose from, the more interesting the resulting image is likely to be.. but it is also more probable that one or more of these images will appear in very similar places in the composition. I need to develop a code that places the images in a more constrained, or modular fashion. For the time being, my view is only of a primordial bellybutton, with not enough distance to be able to percieve the greater whole of the cosmic torso. Let me tell you, it is not pretty.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_487\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"200\" caption=\"Life, in a NodeBox nutshell\"]<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-487\" title=\"celeb393\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/celeb393-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"Life, in a NodeBox nutshell\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />[/caption]\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_460\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"200\" caption=\"&quot;This spread represents someone striving towards their goals at any cost.

It would be too hard to program the NodeBox to actually analyze an image and find some words or recognisable patterns in it. It would be nice to study cold reading and what makes people find meanings in random shapes, but I think there are brighter minds researching that area. Anyway, I feel more interested in completing my second idea now.\r\n\r\n<strong>Engricher</strong> would be a visual engrish generator. There are few in the web but it seems they are all only text based:\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/picture-42.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-681\" title=\"picture-42\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/picture-42.png\" alt=\"picture-42\" width=\"500\" height=\"319\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://pigeond.net/e2e.html\">English to Engrish</a> \u0096 this one uses the <a href=\"http://babelfish.yahoo.com/\">babelfish</a> translator (like the name implies), through which it recycles the input text. What makes this one really interesting is that it also displays the Japanese word and the process how it got to the end result. Funny, this is probably how many engrishness comes to be: somebody at the other end is using Babelfish or Google translator.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://steinhoffen.tripod.com/engrish.html\">The Engrish Generator</a> \u0096 Figures out a name for your invented product and \"transrates\" a slogan for it. You can also choose a product category from a list. This feature is interesting, but you can't really see how all of this works so it could just generate them from a list of phrases randomly or whatever. No points for the visual outlook either. Be warned: The site also hosts some irritating pop-ups.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flashninjaclan.com/zzz2539_Uber_Engrish_Generator.php\">The Uber Engrish Generator</a> \u0096 The name promises a lot but the end result is not quite up for it. After we have seen the fairly embarrasing intro and reach the actual application we still have to listen to the annoying music in the background. What is nice though, is the possibility to choose from a multiple languages. Even dutch! This produces not so interesting results, however. It seems that one of the key ingredients of engrish is a different written language system.\r\n\r\nSo how would <strong>The Engricher</strong> differ from these? Well, it would produce a visual outlook that is not only text based. By using a image library, it would generate, for instance, t-shirt designs that could be straight from the shelf of a clothing store in japan. The user could adjust the engrishness through variables: the more engriched, the more \"cultural divide noise\" would appear. This means the amount of randomness what comes to the relation of the text and images, the possibility of grammatical and typing errors in english language, etc. The above would be created in NodeBox by using lists, variables, an image library, and possibly an imported .xml-file.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/freedom-is-unrestrained.jpg\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-326\" title=\"freedom-is-unrestrained\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/freedom-is-unrestrained.jpg\" alt=\"freedom-is-unrestrained\" width=\"400\" height=\"503\" /></a>\r\n\r\nList of things to do, learn and study:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>variables and the <em>var</em> command</li>\r\n\t<li>lists: choosing letters or words from a list, then manipulating the randomness of their order</li>\r\n\t<li>Creating a relevant image library (or letting NodeBox create it?)</li>\r\n\t<li>creating a xml-file and using it \u0096 as a reference of grammatical rules, for example.</li>\r\n\t<li>wordnet: letting Nodebox retrieve information from the net and using it for the visual output</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nBasically The Engricher could be produced with Nodebox very simply, while it still stays true to it's core idea. Only one slider that would control the \"engrichness\" could suffice. However, the NodeBox offers numerous possibilies and features that would be interesting to put in use. For example: Many of the engrish generators use online translating services to recycle the input text through them while referencing to their Japanese and English dictionaries. This feature could also be used in my app -&gt; NodeBox could cycle the inputted text through a web translator and start playing around with the retrieved words.\r\n\r\nThe possibilies and features that could be added are numerous. However, while taking some time off from coding and computers in the weekend I realized something: The possibilities of NodeBox inspire and excite me but I'm a graphic designer, not a programmer. I should stick to what I know and what interests me the most. If I forget this I'm afraid that I try too much and do not get anything done. That's why I should plan thoroughly what to do next and just create something that works. For probably that's all that I have time for anyway. And immediately when it starts to feel that it just doesn't work despite of everything, switch to plan B.\r\n\r\nAnd remember to <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTJ7AzBIJoI\">wear sunscreen</a> and sleep well. Which is what I'm going to do now."

    "body": "So, the end of the first week, and I'm making progress with the nuts and bolts of my horoscope generator. The next step will be to design some images to populate the code.. and I think that it is this step that will then begin to dictate the coding requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, my mind has drifted back to thoughts of the narrative project my fellow students are undertaking back home. Over the last month, I have been thinking about the possibility of a randomly-generated visual narrative (that's a comic, in popular English!). I was reminded of this while looking at Henning Wagenbreth's website.. his strips are very geometrical, with an almost modular look to them, as though one might be able to move the panels around with the mouse. Well, you can't, but it made me start thinking about this idea again. So I did some research.. the first (I'm sure there are a few) comic strip generator I found is <a href=\"http://www.leonatkinson.com/random/index.php/comic.html\">here</a>.\r\nIn truth, it's rubbish. Politely sidestepping aesthetic concerns, the strips are simply nonsensical - they are too random. This seems to be the result of an over-zealous random-text-generator, so the disappointing results are not really surprising. However, aside from this, it is actually somewhat successful in narrative terms, due to the limit of three frames.. a beginning, a middle, and an end - nice and simple! We can have random parameters, but we need to add our own constraints I think. I found an interesting blog about generative comics, <a href=\"http://grandtextauto.org/2004/09/02/comic-interaction/\">here</a> .. the author also feels that a truly random extended narrative is a big problem. But I think that a three (or four panel) news-strip-style comic generator would be very possible in NodeBox.. an interesting idea that I would like to pursue. And, truth be told, most of the comics I read these days are barely intelligible anyway.. so perhaps a comics-generator that produces strips in a Fort Thunder/Paper Rad/Picture Box stylee would be pretty easy after all!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.plasticdog.com/ecards/index.php?id=37\">Henning Wagenbreth</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.ambiguousmass.org/ambergris/LakeSerious.jpg\">Matthew Thurber</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.digitalmediatree.com/library/image/88/dr_doo.jpg\">Paper Rad</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.leonatkinson.com/random/index.php/comic.html\"></a>"

    "body": "Ideas for generative book design...\r\n\r\nI've thought about using modules of some kind for ornamentation. These modules (of vector forms) could be positioned based on a hierarchy: 1st the canvas size is set (format) and all the text fields are positioned (content), then the remaining space is filled entirely by predefined modules of ornament. The modules also have a hierarchy of their own based on size: biggest modules are placed 1st, wherever they fit, followed by smaller and smaller modules. Possibly the shape and texture of the modules also change as they become smaller. The last module would be only a fraction of the 1st in size (something barely visible).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the modules could be closed line forms (\"thread\" loops) that are placed on a path that serves as some kind of spine for an ornamental border. The border could be mirrored in the x or y axis (or both). This would be somewhat similar to the example of generative book-covers linked in the previous post. The Faber covers are a bit primitive though, since there is no interaction between the modules. I would like to see the modules synthesized somehow: to create a fabric of ornament where no modules are actually placed over or underneath eachother, but instead tied together. Every \"thread\" has a modulating way of handling the intersections (over, under, over, under, &amp;c.) becoming a part of the fabric. This results in a curious ambivalency of depth which is the special thing about the \"knot\" ornaments (illustrated in the previous post as well).\r\n\r\nThe \"generative\" concept could also be reversed. A 15th century book, for example, is printed with woodcuts (images) and movable metal type (text). Both materials are sensitive to degeneration; wearing out in constant use. (The former much more than the latter, I think.) A modern analogy for this could be photographs and jpeg compression. A jpeg file can be saved with a low quality, the low quality file opened, saved again with a lower quality, opened again, &amp;c. The size of the file (amount of data) will reduce until some point and stop, but even after reaching the smallest size, the image keeps changing (the visual information degenerates). This kind of jpeg compression loop could be utilized for books that are printed one by one (print-on-demand): every book would have slightly different image content that degenerates in small steps until the end of the \"print-run\" (which is basically inifite)."

Today, conversation turned to Scientology, and my thoughts to the 'pataphysical consideration of religion as a system of assumptions based on assumptions. So, a Cult Generator perhaps.. you would input a \"sensible\" assumption.. and a string of related, but steadily more incredible, assumptions would be returned. The generative brainwasher could be an optional add-on. Hannu related this train of thought to Monty Python &amp; The Holy Grail, and its system for identifying a witch (heavier or lighter than a duck?). Not the first mention of Monty Python today, or, indeed, in my short time in Finland. It is, it would seem, an international favourite! \u00a0\r\n\r\nBut back to Nodebox. Today we tried the latest model. A much more user-friendly interface, but, ironically, after a week of coding, I found it hard to get to grips with. So it was with renewed vigour that I dove back into my epic struggles with Python. After much pinching of brow, and extended rumination on the site tutorials, I finally managed to render the basic template (a layout with recursive border)\u00a0for my horoscope cards. It's taken me several hours to achieve what would probably have taken others in the group no time at all, but it's deepened my understanding of the operational logic of the code, and I feel like I have achieved something - yes! Now I have a basis within which I can begin to visualise a composition for the final outcomes. I'm still not entirely sure how the \"cards\" will look. I've already decided that to base them on the tarot deck would be too involving for our time-scale, and I'd rather produce images which have more immediate symbolic resonance for people..so more of a general 'horoscope'.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_730\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"300\" caption=\"Excerpt from &quot;Atomic Yggdrasil Tarot&quot; by Daniel A.I.U.

This interaction with the symbolic syntax of the individual (and the coincidences it might spawn) is more interesting to me than the closely governed parameters of online tarot, where the meaning is recited from a book. At the same time, I want the images to be more fun and accessible than Higgs', but without being tacky. It's also important to me that the images don't look like randomly-stuck-together parts, like an exquisite corpse. So these are the thoughts I will be pursuing now.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, here is a video of one of Friday's experiments. Visuals for an imaginary club event: HORSERAVE. K-18.

    "body": "Since the dream journal would show connections between dreams based on keywords and categories, I need to figure out which categories to use. Obviously, the words tagged to each will depend on what happened them but there are general groups that could be marked somehow. I looked at different dream diary wedsites, there's a view of one below. I have thought of many of the categories myself but haven't decided how they should be presented.\r\n\r\nThe dream diary will be a cross between mindmaps and blogs. Existing mindmapping tools don't work for this because I don't like them visually and because I need different sorting categories. Some of them also have a monthly or yearly fee and I don't feel like paying for a system I don't even like. Most dream diary websites I wouldn't even consider using. I will much rather continue writing dreams in notebooks. I'm also not interested enough to spend all my time writing my dreams into a database that is basically the same as my notebooks, I'll rather continue living and dreaming. A mindmap makes sense but drawing a huge one on paper doesn't do the trick - I want to see different connections, and since dreaming never stops, there will always be new connections.\r\n\r\nAlso, whatever I do becomes part of my thinking and visual world, and will affect my dreaming. Sleeping and not sleeping, sleeping enough and not sleeping enough, dreaming and being awake - it's all fascinating. I've had dreams about the workshop.. very little about coding, more about the social relations and the conceptual core. I don't want to link a horrible blog to a great part of my life. Many sites seem to be based on the idea that others can help interpret dreams. I don't think strangers necessarily help interpreting dreams of people and situations they don't know. There may be common symbols (some dream diaries have a good database of different symbols that are interesting) but I don't think they're key to interpretation unless they're really important to the dreamer herself. I've held dream diaries for about fifteen years, and dream symbol books have not played a part.\r\n\r\nPerhaps at this point it doesn't even matter how I name the categories or how many of them there are. I want to use my drawings to make the visual side of this. I draw by hand but need to scan and, I assume, vectorize the drawings because I want to make animations. I assume this will take quite a long time.\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-783\" title=\"picture-13\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/picture-13.png\" alt=\"picture-13\" width=\"1005\" height=\"794\" />"

There have been some sophisticated ideas arising from the workshop, and it's hard for me not to feel like the class idiot sometimes. One positive that came out of the morning's\u00a0group presentation was that I know exactly what I need to do to complete my project. However, I've run into some problems in rendering my images in Nodebox, problems that have nothing to do with Finnish, or Nodebox. I'm missing my friends, but I'm missing my scanner more! None of these problems are insurmountable, but the end result is that sadly I have nothing worth posting here today.. hopefully, tomorrow will deliver\u00a0the needed\u00a0breakthroughs, and my project will properly assume its shape (it's not far off, just in\u00a0insufficient resolution!).

Can't say I understand the whole math/code mechanism (at least yet), but it definitely looks like a fascinating tool for creating patterns. Just repeating a single form (like a circle) with loops or a grid produces interesting fabric-like patterns.\r\n\r\nThe intersections are not handled as literally as I thought: sometimes a single path goes two (or more) times over or two times under. The problem, as Frederik explained it, is that the \"connecting\" of individual forms is done before the whole \"fabric\" is finished, so the ideal over/under structure cannot be predicted. I'm not sure if I should care about this or not.\r\n\r\nSome possibilities to consider next: using alternating forms (circle, square, circle, square...), importing paths (modules) from Illustrator, self-referencing structures, mirroring parts of the fabric to create borders...\r\n\r\nHere's two more repeating forms (an oval &amp; a square):\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/forloops_ovalsquare.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-977\" title=\"forloops_ovalsquare\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/forloops_ovalsquare.png\" alt=\"forloops_ovalsquare\" width=\"600\" height=\"1155\" /></a>"

I've sometimes thought that I could make a font or something that would make those kinds of variations, and now that I understand a little about NodeBox it might be the program for this, but maybe it would take the fun out of my quick morning ritual?\r\n\r\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-986\" title=\"ah_kuvio\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/ah_kuvio.jpg\" alt=\"ah_kuvio\" width=\"838\" height=\"879\" />\r\n\r\nThese are all images or types of images I might use.

The size and placement of the elements would be related to the format and the content would be derived from the word. Does this make any sense to anyone but me?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/rules21.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1056\" title=\"rules21\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/rules21.png\" alt=\"rules21\" width=\"538\" height=\"418\" /></a>\r\n\r\nAnyway, this way it is be easier to figure out what are the steps which I have to take and in which order I should take them. My idea is pretty simple but there are complicated parts needed to complete it. With great help from Tom and Lucas I have managed to piece together some parts of the puzzle but there still some missing, and some not quite fitting. NodeBox wizards from the Future, please come to my aid!\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Some issues:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>I can get text translated from english to japanese but not back to english from japanese. Something to do with unicode?</li>\r\n\t<li>The document width/height ratio resizing the headline text doesn't quite work. Still, thanks tom! Maybe I just have to find a way around it.</li>\r\n\t<li>I still don't know how to retrieve images from the translated word and to place them.</li>\r\n\t<li>I have to find a way to make a list of words from the translated word. How could this be done? Search for the word in google and retrieve the first 5-10 labels for that word? Maybe to use something that is used in the wordnet examples like explode and prism...?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u0085</p>"

I'm also curious to see what more Tom comes up with from looking at the genetic algorithms \u0096 I hope I'm able to pick up some understanding from all of this too, so that I eventually can work with the genetic algorithms myself."

At this point for me the visual development is interesting enough.

So let the ants have fun together whether their sex is or what kind of new ants they 're creating.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere you can see 2d- and two 3d-movies where my meetings are at this point.\r\n\r\n\u00a0\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/coincidence.mov\">coincidence</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/coincidence.mov\"></a><a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/coincidence2.mov\">coincidence2</a>\u00a0\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/coincidence3.mov\">coincidence3</a>"

    "body": "There has been a lot of wailing and gnashing of the teeth lately. I haven't been very active on the blog, as well. Wednesday and thursday swooped by with me sitting in front of my computer noding and sweating code as hard as I could. In the end I managed to piece together my work (with non-replaceable help from Tom and everyone) , and it isn't half bad. Yay!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/picture-15.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1228\" title=\"picture-15\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/picture-15.png\" alt=\"picture-15\" width=\"539\" height=\"528\" /></a>\r\n\r\nBefore I present everything, I would like to rewind a little and explain why I chose <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engrish\">Engrish</a> as a base for work.\r\n\r\nAs a graphic designer I think that the message we want to convey is the most important thing in our work. Thus, if there is text, it should work together with the visuals, preferably adding something to that message. If I were to design something with, for example, Arabic text I'd like to find out what does the overall design say to someone who understands Arabic language and culture. I think it would be embarrassing not to do so. Especially when designing mundane everyday things, like advertisements or package designs, we need to be as certain as we can be of the message those designs hold, as lot of people can interpret them in many ways. Ambiguity is not a desirable factor in every day graphic design.\r\n\r\nThis is why I'm amazed of the amount Japanese graphic designs that use English, with the outcome often looking as silly or even uncomprehensible. If the Japanese can't use English properly, why do they put it in their designs so much? Even big and credible companies do it a lot in Japan. The faq in <a href=\"http://www.engrish.com/\">Engrish dot com</a> has a good answer to this question:\r\n<blockquote><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Most of the Engrish found on Engrish.com is not an attempt to communicate - English is used as a design element in Japanese products and advertising to give them a modern look and feel (or just to \u0093look cool\u0094). There is often no attempt to try to get it right, nor do the vast majority of the Japanese population (= consumers) ever attempt to read the English design element in question.</span></blockquote>\r\nSo the Japanese, who you would presume to be otherwise so careful in what they say, aren't so particulate when it comes to English in design. After thinking about it, it makes a lot of sense, though. Engrish.com had more to say on this:\r\n<blockquote><span style=\"color: #666699;\">Quite often it is easier to come up with English names than Japanese for a particular product. New products are brought to the marketplace in Japan more than anywhere else in the world and Japanese words and slogans quickly get used up. Japanese graphic designers will often tell you that English is widespread because the Japanese writing script (or scripts) limits their creativity - there are only so many ways to display their language, and only so many different types of fonts to use.</span></blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I find this extremely fascinating. In a way, the Japanese are looking at these products like a pieces of abstract art. To the major Japanese public, the western type forms in these products have no meaning in content, only as forms or design elements. On the other hand, if you understand English and especially it's cultural connotations, there is a good chance that these will look funny to you. In today's visually over-saturated world, various brands compete in trying to produce striking graphics to influence the consumers. But free trade and competition in today's global economy has made many of the products essentially the same in content. In some cases, the only difference between those products is the packaging. So why one would be better than another?</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In a way, these Japanese graphic designs are creating a parody of the whole industry. Perhaps through them, we can see that in the end it doesn't actually make any difference what's printed on these products. Furthermore, we might notice that the ideas and messages the commercial graphic designs are trying to convey are just meaningless gibberish, not to be noted. These designs work like a big <em>disinformation graphics machine</em>, continuously producing visual messages that lack meaning, and as such, are not relevant.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u0085</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>The Engricher</strong> is an attempt to explore this thought. It generates a piece of visual identity for a given concept, based on how the internet treats that concept with some fundamentals of <em>Engrish</em> applied. After you have typed in text in English, The Engricher translates the text to Japanese, then back to english. It then chooses the word from that sentence which is used for the headline or the logotype, if you will. That same word is used for a search term to retrieve information from the web. Using that word, it searches through <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/kuler/\">kuler</a> for color values and through <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/\">flickr</a> for images that users have tag with that word. Next, it fills the background of the visual output with that colour and pics a complement color (yet slightly darker) for the color of the texts (so that they would be more visible). Then it chooses the typeface for the headline and the \"slogan\" texts from a list of fonts I manually created. Finally, it draws two visual elements: a swooshy type of line path horizontally from left to right, and an circle, which is randomly placed at the screen.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">The Engricher tends to gives better results if the inputted text is longer, and doesn't quite work for only a one word.</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u0085</p>\r\n\r\nSo, it is finished for now and it works. I still think I chose too complicated of an idea, though: there are lot of stuff that still could be explored and experimented with it and it could work better or produce more interesting results. Plus, I really had a hard time doing it, and I needed a lot of help from Frederik and the gang. I should have realized: I'm not a coder and instead of trying play one I could have just done something that visually interest me but isn't so complicated. Still, I think I deserve a pat on the back. I think I really came a long way in this course and I want to continue experimenting with NodeBox even once this course is over when I'm finally starting to get the hang of it. Last night, while doing my presentation with InDesign, I pressed<em> command+r </em>instead of <em>enter </em>when I wanted to edit the measurements of a text frame! Yikes :D I hope the version 2 comes out soon!\r\n\r\nThank you, everyone! This has been one of the hardest school projects but also one of the most rewarding. It was real fun having lunch and hanging around in the class with everyone. Everyone made really interesting blog posts too. During the workshopsI even read them in the evenings at home. I hope I have a chance to some way participate in this workshop again someday.\r\n<blockquote><em><a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/thanks1.png\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1218\" title=\"thanks1\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/thanks1-300x226.png\" alt=\"thanks1\" width=\"300\" height=\"226\" /></a>\r\n</em></blockquote>"

I thought about making frames this way, but I'm not there yet. The results get a bit unpredictable when the svg's are more complicated. Lately, I've kept changing my mind about how the weaving mechanism should work. Should Nodebox output full frame compositions or just singular elements to be combined manually? The former feels a bit too uncontrollable &amp; complex, the latter a bit boring. What's the most reasonable thing for Nodebox to do? Maybe the arrangement of modules (or groups of modules) needs different rules. The mirroring idea was something that didn't materialize yet. Another thing that could make this concept (of book ornamentation) more \"generative\" would be to limit the amount of intersections at one place: pushing the intersections away from eachother (as mentioned in the previous post). I was pleased to introduce at least some interaction with the modules, but maybe there should have been more of it."

    "body": "\u00a0\r\n\r\nSo two weeks behind with the NodeBox. The theme \"Coincidence\" is now finalised as a python-file which you are able to copy and play with.\r\n\r\n<strong>My Coincidence concept is based on \"meetings\"</strong>\r\n\r\n\u0093I wasn\u0092t expecting that\u0094, \u0093It just happened\u0094, \u0093I met her coincidentally\u0094, \u0093I saw an old friend of mine. That was really a coincidence.\u0094 These are explanations of meetings. How did you meet your girl/boyfriend or wife/husband? Was it a coincidence?\r\n\r\nCoincidences are sort of surprises (in good or bad). When we meet people coincidentally, what is behind that moment. In what kind of situations, environments those meeting coincidences happen. We need company to survive and keep in balance. We go to bars, perhaps sit beside the computer and chat or create an avatar to meet people in Second Life or other meeting environments.\u00a0So, it needs two persons and a sort of movement to make coincidence happen. What happens before that? You don\u0092t find people by coincidence. You have certain purposes for meetings whether the meeting is a coincidence or organized.\r\n\r\nWe are objects, we move randomly, we meet people by accident. We have common interests, we communicate with each other. We start our moving e.g. from home. We meet people at work, in the city, on the bus or train. In those places not by coincidence. We move in a certain area, using different random paths at random time but usually by purpose.\r\n\r\nIt could be so that by coincidence we are not meeting anybody during the day. But if we meet \u0093interesting\u0094 people we might communicate. We have certain parameters like man, woman, name, outlook, hobby, interests, visual values and so on which are affecting to the interests of communicating with each other.\r\n\r\n<strong>Using NodeBox to make my concept visible</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal; \">How to visualize a meeting? I think by showing some movement. Moving itself is not so interesting. But for sure the coincidental meeting has to affect to the overall image somehow. So I decided to show the meeting using animations. At this time you are not able to use the brand new NodeBox for making animations. That feature is available later.</span></strong>\r\n\r\nWhat happens when we meet each other. To put it simple and related to long time curve, we are duplicating ourselves, making children, giving a birth.\r\n\r\nTo reach the visual target I need to set all the parameters technically:\r\n\r\n1) Creature = ant and its features like size, shape, colour, behaviour, meeting and total age etc.\r\n\r\n2) Random moving and meeting regulations, where to start, where to aim, how long the movement lasts,\u00a0when meeting is possible. Moving leaves visual trail behind, so I need to specify its parameters: how long, time when visible, colour, shape\r\n\r\n3) Meeting produces a new ant, parameters for it like the parents have.\r\n\r\n4) Parameters for the background and overall visualisation\r\n\r\n\u00a0\u0093Ants\u0094 are moving, meeting and creating new \u0093ants\u0094. Their movement is affecting to the environment/background building new visual approaches randomly. I added also some text to describe the scenery and give a graphic design touch. You can play with 2d or 3d versions, where 2d is much quicker to use. I tried to keep the overall visualisation quite simple to let the animation catch the eye.\u00a0Ants don\u0092t have sex or any individual parameters, those parameters could be interesting to get from webdatabases to create visually mixed new ants and give them computer generated names or show which ant is male and which female and so on. Perhaps I play with the meeting material after the workshop and develop some new NodeBox animations.\r\n\r\n<strong>What is for?</strong>\r\n\r\nIt's an experimentation not made with purpose. But for sure you can use it as a screensaver or just play with it or send it to your friends as a party invitation.\r\n\r\n<strong>A couple of movies to describe the final outcome</strong>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/coincidence1_1cmpr.mov\">coincidence1_1cmpr</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/coincidence3_2cmpr.mov\">coincidence3_2cmpr</a>"

    "body": ".. is how the saying goes. And I think that, despite some glitches, and elements that I am not totally happy with, the resulting images are quite bold and impactful, so at least one aspect has gone according to plan! Otherwise, as mentioned in previous blogs, there are things that took much longer than expected, elements that I would like to redraw, elements that I would like to add, and variables that I would like to toy with.. so my Nodebox experience is not over yet! But I've really enjoyed learning the program, and seeing everyone else's interesting ideas, and the experience has definitely improved my Photoshop skills (despite evidence to the contrary). It has also really opened my eyes to the possibilities of generative art. Despite the odd glitch, a majority of my images have rendered in ways that I have found surprising and pleasing - a success! It has been interesting trying to find a balance between randomised events, and the designers instinctive desire for control, but I'm sorry I haven't had more time to play with the possibilities of generated symmetrys (however, I'm sure the long Finnish nights will allow me time for this in the months to come, if I'm not too busy catching up on all the links on my comrade's blogs, or watching Zardoz on a loop..). My horoscope generator has just enough variables to provide interesting images, but there is obviously room for a lot more. I'm pleased with my final results, but it's perhaps a shame that the need for a significant basic level of content, due to the format, has limited my time to play with other aspects of the program.. \r\n.. it would have been nice to add some text too.

I assume it's pretty clear since I've shown sketches before. I thought a changing part could be adding a hand-drawn heading to each dream while rest of the text would be typed in.\r\n\r\nI haven't gotten very far with the technical side of the dream diary and have been thinking about the elements and categories. Therefore I decided to make coincidental art with NodeBox in ways that I have learnt, using parts from my paintings and drawings. I extracted little parts from larger very detailed works and coincidentally things came out that weren't there originally! I'm always doing that when I'm drawing, things just start to appear (similar to broccoli heads) on the paper/canvas... So in the middle of a painting full of plants and colours, I found puppies, a frog and a tree spirit, at least that's what they look like to me - something trippy that might be part of a children's book illustration. I used paths drawn in Illustrator (following some lines of the background forest) to place the elements, so they vary and can be made into a movie (there are two examples with pretty much the same script):\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/puppy_and_frogs.mov\">Coincidental art</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/sleeping_puppy.mov\">Another one</a>\r\n\r\nTo me, the movies look like windy autumn sceneries. I think with some experimenting and tweaking I could make interesting illustrations by re-using images and parts of images in NodeBox. I love drawing and painting by hand and am not convinced that computer-made images based on hand-drawn drawings can ever look as interesting as the original ones but I'm curious to explore. At least improved versions could become parts of animations, little games and web media (and the dream diary when it's animated in the way that I imagine it to be, kind of organically moving and changing).\r\n\r\nHere you can see the elements in the movie clips above:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/puppy_etc.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1297\" title=\"puppy_etc\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/puppy_etc.jpg\" alt=\"puppy_etc\" width=\"482\" height=\"842\" /></a>\r\n\r\nRather than something only going on for two weeks to which I'll never return, this has been a beginning in some ways. I've learnt about NodeBox and coding a little, and I've been able to explore thoughts and ideas I've had on my mind for a long time, for example, dreams and coincidence. It's been a fascinating workshop!"

For Paul and Benoit this is new, but that does not matter...\r\n\r\nIn bold is the transcript of the story, in italic are some second (<em>or third</em>) thoughts and the regular type \"wraps\" the story.\r\n\r\n<strong>On my way to the bus \u00a0(that would take me to the airport where a plane would take me to another airport and another bus would take me to another car that would take me to my appartment in Lahti) I was driving my car. On the road in front of me I see a plastic bag. Like this:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/plasticbag.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1329\" title=\"plasticbag\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/plasticbag.jpg\" alt=\"plasticbag\" width=\"591\" height=\"443\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Of course I avoided hitting the bag (who knows what people throw away in bags!) and steered my car nicely over the bag. <em><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">(If the bag looks like a rabbit this is pure coincidence, it was a plastic bag!)</span></em></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Curious, as anyone would be, I looked in my rear mirror to see it again and was expecting to see this:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/plasticbag1.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1331\" title=\"plasticbag1\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/plasticbag1.jpg\" alt=\"plasticbag1\" width=\"591\" height=\"443\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>To my surprise, it looked like this:</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/noplasticbag.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1330\" title=\"noplasticbag\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2009/wp-content/uploads/noplasticbag.jpg\" alt=\"noplasticbag\" width=\"591\" height=\"443\" /></a></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>\r\n</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>The bag was gone! It must have been taken by some nut or some bolt from my car, and I was probably shlepping an unknown thing along my path. I checked my rear mirror constantly to see the bag appear again eventually but that did not happen. Arriving at the bus station where my wife took over I checked the bottom of the car: nothing!</strong>\r\n\r\nSo far for the story. Now I told you then that the story had nothing to do with the workshop (<em>sincerely)</em> but that after all (<em>that means now) <span style=\"font-style: normal;\">it might appear to have everything to do with the workshop (</span>sincerely<span style=\"font-style: normal;\">).

By type, does it mean like typography, or other meaning, for example \u0093what kind of type of a person?\u0094.</span></strong>\r\n\r\nI started a mind map from the second meaning. Word \u0093social\u0094 I related to humans, interaction and entertainment, and the \u0093type\u0094 lead me thinking directly the types of above-mentioned things.\r\n\r\nBy searching the amazing interweb I found an archive of academic journals for scholars and researchers (www.jstor.org).\u00a0 Simply by searching with the title of our theme I found an article called \u0093The fool as a social type\u0094 http://www.jstor.org/pss/2770893 \u00a0This leads me to think the Fool, as a clown and Jester. This sounds good for the social idea of a entertainment I was thinking earlier. Generally the word \u0093social\u0094 tastes little bit bitter to me, and I gladly removed the space between \u0093a\u0094 and the \u0093social\u0094. So I had an idea of asocial entertainment of the bitter Jester. Just to have some weird, conflicting starting point without any sense at all.\r\n\r\n<strong>Visual material\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">I wanted to search some visual material around the mind flow to have something to inspire. Or lead me closer to understand what I\u0092m suppose to do. The same amazing interweb also offered me wide range of image material for the topic. Jester is so common and old character that I was able to find many kind of materials. Some little bit scaring and some really childish. Conventions for those all was for example clothing. Hats and jingle bells appeared to be almost in every image. Also bright colors were one common thing.</span></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong> </strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><strong>Conclusion\r\n<span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">So now I start to play with same nuances and shapes as in the material I collected. From the material I can somehow probably think words or sentences if I need to. I assume we don\u0092t need to think the movement or interaction, but for that I still had idea to move components, what ever they will be, in the same way as Jester would throw balls, or other objects to entertain people. Maybe in this case he would throw something more evil and aim the audience\u0085</span></strong></strong>\r\n\r\nOr something."

Social interaction is all about communication, so I started to think the Facebook status view as a constant flow of personal tabloid headlines. I'm curious, how would this days \"DailyFacebook\" headline page look like. So if technically possible, I would like to tap into the Facebook feed to collect headlines. These headlines would then be sorted by popularity ie. the amount of comments and likes. The more popular a status was, the bigger the headline.\n\nAdditionally, because interaction is the core of social communication, it would be interesting to see correlation between statuses. Draw the line between a two statuses, whose author has commented the other, so revealing interaction.\n\n<b>The Surname Cloud</b>\nWhile thinking tapping into Facebook could be technically too hard, I thought of an other approach. Social communication is what happens between individuals, and individuals are denoted by name, to be more precise, first name. So I tried to look up for a list of finnish first names and their popularity, but couldn't find one, so I ended up with a data sheet from Finnish Population Register ( http://www.vaestorekisterikeskus.fi/ ), that listed all the 250 000+ surnames of finnish citizens, and the amount of people carrying that name. I came up with an idea to list all (or at least couple of thousand most common) surnames, and like in Facebook headlines, change the point size according to name prevalence. Additionally the names could be color coded by first letter, so the list could be furthermore dissected into more manageable blocks, and maybe to show correlation between surname and first letter prevalence."

I noticed that if person is social he has to belong somewhere culture, environment. Social behavior is big part of every culture. Then I remembered an idea: if someone belongs to some culture he remembers at least one children\u0092s poem. And usually children\u0092s games and poems are first steps to social life.\r\nSo I think I would do funny typography. Maybe I use old children\u0092s poems. I want my poster will be playful."

I typed in the word social and got pictures of people having fun together - which didn't interest me that much. What DID caught my eye were these diagrams of social networks. Although they're (kind of) simple and rough and in no means meant to be 'art' or anything else than just diagrams, but that's exactly what got my interest. I really think it might turn to something interesting if I just move the base idea a bit further...\n\nAnother thing that popped to my mind today - or rather what popped up in my laptop's screen as I was drawing with tablet; faces. I remember reading something about how people have these 'social masks' which we change depending on the situation and the people we're associating with. I have yet to find out how to develop this to something that would work along with the assignment..but ideas are just ideas.\n...\nI guess I should do some sketching"

On a practical level, I also chose the letter \"i\" because of it's form, which renders the human figure in the most basic sense - e.g. the dot of the \"i\" resembles the human head.

The original image was the A -thing from the sketch of the day two which was multiplied four times. I started with simple thing, I only changed the rotation of one component in the group and copied the group to seven columns. Results are below. This is never ending swamp, but sooo fun to play with. Next I probably print the image and start to search some forms from these combinations, just in case if they will look like a type... by accident.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/kokeiluja.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-287\" title=\"kokeiluja\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/kokeiluja-300x127.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"127\" /></a>"

The idea is writte the word \"internet\" with a wide-band cable, so thath the concept has more consistency. I want to put more cable connections to simulate internet networks, and refer to the number of connections that can be in the same network.\n\nI tried to draw many wide-band cable, with different colors, to make a distinction between them, and between the different communications that can be found on the Internet. (I have no scanner and so today I could not hang the picture .... hang it tomorrow).\n\nI've also been looking for pictures to add some concept to the final poster. And I found various scribbles, that reminds me of coiled wires.\n\nI like the idea of doodle because it helps define the concept of connection between different lines and shows the relationships that may exist between them."

Patterns are quite messy because they are based on the sketch, and there is lot of points in the original file. Even though I hunted some shapes from the image maze which could form a some letters, or other characters. Some parts of the patterns formed also some human shapes, but I thought I could devote this day for type.

This time I took the whole word \"antihero\" and made few tests how it would behave in pattern. Cleaner version on the left is without the hand shapes, and it almost looks like nice and friendly. Almost too nice when there isn't almost any sharp shapes. </span></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><span style=\"font-weight: normal;\">Version on the right includes also the hand parts so there is more contrast between the shapes. I rather would go in this direction, because the abstract idea behind the illustration was this antisocial person who perform and entertain people, but who is not liking that at all. So there should somehow be dilemmas and contrast and confusion and and and and...</span></strong>"

Besides the dirtiness of the earlier versions, they also were lacking some dynamic movement and direction. It was also little bit hard to imagine how different images are behaving in the pattern grid, what part ends where and what part will continue from where etc. I though that it's so easy to just take any sketch and throw it to the grid in Nodebox and have interesting results by luck.\r\n\r\nNow I wanted to really understand the structure, how the movement and wholeness is changing depending of one component and it's shape. And to learn how to control it and really design instead of luck. Of course lady luck and mindless tryouts are important, but in some stage it's just good to be the commander. As you can see in the image, there is two simple parts highlighted, one is orange, and other is grey. This pair is copied with two grid-nodes.\r\n\r\nSo now I have simple template for pattern design, and it's made in Nodebox. I also managed to use the expressions in the grid-node, when I wanted to expand the already structured pattern, and not mess the positions between the components inside the pattern. If this explains something.\r\n\r\nThat's all for today."

The strongest idea i have to accompany a subject to the theme is to create a design that encourages people NOT to vote altogether in elections.\nI am still refining which demographics to target, which area of politics, which country, ethic standings etc. I know that i am unable to convince every key demographic with one poster, so i would rather get one spot on and achieve it well, all be it facetious.\n\nWhat other things could you be doing in the time that it takes to place a vote? is it enough time to play three games of pool? phone a distant relative? hook up with an ex-girlfriend/boyfriend? choose, buy and try out some new underwear?\nThoughts?"

I would like to use those patterns to create a visual form that would somehow remind you of familiarity and warmth.\n\nMy first scetch reminded me more of a carpet, but I've decided to move towards classical quilt designs. They often show a very appealing mixture of cozyness and strict geometrical patterns and shapes. Also they represent the idea of creating something whole and new out of something small and useless.\n\nHere are a couple of quilt designs:\n\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/qm106-web-photo_lq8q.jpg\"><img src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/qm106-web-photo_lq8q-244x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"qm106-web-photo_lq8q\" width=\"244\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-429\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/tradewinds-quilt21.jpg\"><img src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/tradewinds-quilt21-268x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"tradewinds-quilt2\" width=\"268\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-430\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/qm115-web-photo_uvs8.jpg\"><img src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/qm115-web-photo_uvs8-252x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"qm115-web-photo_uvs8\" width=\"252\" height=\"300\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-431\" /></a>"

The eye was good starting point because the mask does not include any eyes. Yet at least. I wanted to have some spotlight idea, that the Joker is in this light when he is performing, but it's really fragile and horrible situation for him, like this would be something how he sees the being in the spotlight. Also it could also mean the light is blinding a little bit, it's possible to see stars or have a feeling that your brains are exploding.</span></strong>\r\n\r\nFor this sketch I didn't use the Nodebox, sorry. But, I started to create the background shape with it. Just in case I would really like to use it later on. I had idea to change the shape or the ends of it, something jingle bell -stuff. I also thought I could try to use some type to form this shape. Like make some letters full of sharp edges and build the background from them. Of course I have these happy words I would like to hide there, such as antihero, exaggeration, deformity, waste..."

So I guess I'll have to rely on knowledge of my guides, to find the right path to my goal.\n\nHere's the state where I got yesterday with the help of Frederik.

The idea of assigning each first letter it's own color produced somewhat trippy poster with all the colors of rainbow. So I started to think alternate techniques to use color. Also got an idea of an alternate approach on visualisation. Earlier I though about packing the names so, that they would not overlap, but packing rectangles requires way too high mathematics. Packing sircles on the other hand would maybe be plausible way... but well, time is getting short, so maybe that's something I'll get into some other time...\n\nMeanwhile here's a draft of the poster, with some trippy colours... dude, it's like 70s again!\n\n<a href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/Day7_poster_draft.png\"><img src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2010/wp-content/uploads/Day7_poster_draft.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"Day7_poster_draft\" width=\"600\" height=\"848\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-571\" /></a>"

Het draait er om dat kleine zaken binnen bepaalde gevoelige systemen grote gevolgen kunnen hebben. De naam is gebaseerd op een metafoor die in 1961 werd gebruikt door Edward Lorenz om aan te geven dat de vleugels van een vlinder in Brazili\u00eb maanden later een tornado in Texas zouden kunnen veroorzaken.\r\nSystemen die eigenschappen van het butterfly effect hebben, en zich dus 'chaotisch' gedragen, zijn onder meer de beurshandel en de atmosfeer.\r\nHet butterfly effect speelt een belangrijke rol binnen de chaostheorie."

What if we could visualize\u00a0this data and discover patterns in the chaos?\r\n\r\nDuring this workshop, we'll use a new tool well suited for visualizing\u00a0data. Through a visual, node-based approach, we'll create interesting\u00a0and unique visualizations that evolve and react on varying input.\u00a0We'll learn how to capture, prepare, visualize and refine data. The\u00a0end result will be a poster with a visualization around a self-chosen\u00a0theme. Enterprising students can even create data animations\u00a0(\"datamations\").\r\n\r\nThis workshop is for designers new to NodeBox and data visualization.\u00a0We will learn to look at data differently, and gain insight in how to\u00a0create new and interesting designs.\r\n\r\nData is taking over your life. It's time to take control.\r\n\r\nThis workshop takes place in the\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.aalto.fi/en/\">Aalto University</a> in Helsinki, Finland from 16 to 27 May.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"

Clay Shirky, gives an example in his book, <strong>Cognitive Surplus</strong>: <em>Creativity and Generosity in a Connected Age</em>, that Americans alone watch about 200bn hours of television a year: that represents, he notes, about 2,000 times the total human hours that have gone so far into creating Wikipedia (approximately 100 million hours.)\r\n\r\nSo my proposal is that, while we are wasting some time on the internet on consuming bad contents, just what sort of creations could emerge by that? The title of the project is called<strong> '3 minutes &amp; 48 seconds'</strong>, an exact length of Rebecca Black's notorious 'Friday' video, officially the most hated video on Youtube. With that time, multiply by almost 200 million views, what sort of projects can humanity create with that space of time?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAfter more searching and thoughts on the project, I've decided to focus the time accumulated by this <strong> '3 minutes &amp; 48 seconds' </strong>into developing open-source projects and sotwares. http://www.ohloh.net/p (Thank you, Frederik!)\r\n\r\nBelow are some samples on how I will visualize the work. There are now two directions, one for those using less time than MV, others using more time. So for the first category, I'm thinking about Tetris model where pieces fit into a box. The second will use 'Friday' currency (1 'Friday' = whole world time spent on watching the MV), and determine the bigger projects how many 'Friday's will they need.\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"attachment wp-att-173\" href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2011-2/approach-for-the-next-assignment-sarun/beth_tetris/\"><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-174\" href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2011-2/approach-for-the-next-assignment-sarun/billion_dollar_960/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-174\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2011-2/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/billion_dollar_960.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"962\" height=\"1417\" /></a><a rel=\"attachment wp-att-177\" href=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2011-2/approach-for-the-next-assignment-sarun/isotype_weaving1/\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-177\" src=\"http://workshops.nodebox.net/2011-2/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/isotype_weaving1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"652\" height=\"649\" /></a>\r\n</a>"

National flags are available as svg files.)\r\n\r\nData from the documentary 'Super Size Me':\r\nThe subject consumed 5000 kcals a day for 30 days\r\nOne Big Mac has 540 kcals\r\nHe gained 11.1 kg during the month, a 13 % increase in body mass\r\n\r\nAverage calorie intake per day (male, 30 yrs, 70 kg, 5'10'', basic metabolic rate): 1666 kcals\r\nhttp://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm:\r\n\r\nWith these data we can calculate how much excess calories a median earner accrues during a month. This amount will be translated to tentative weight gains using the results from Super Size Me.\r\n<strong>Visualisation:</strong>\r\n\r\nPossibly a set of human figures whose corpulence increases as a function of the excess calorie intake (nb. mass ~ volume ~ radius\u00b2). A sofisticated algorith needs to be construed so as to maintain a level of naturality in the effects of obesity: e.g. the waist circumference will increase most rapidly, eyes will not be spread further apart although cheeks will get fatter, etc. This can be accomplished, for example, by manipulating path points directly in predrawn vector shapes for different body parts and translating dependent parts correspondingly (the arms must move when the torso gets thicker).\r\n\r\nThe figures will be either coloured with the national colours obtained from the second data set or overlayed with the national flags.\r\n\r\nInformative labels (such as country, Big Macs eaten, minutes to work / Big Mac) will be shown, too."

I\u00b4m not sure I will find this because is very recent, although I found a <a href=\"http://www.lynce.es/es/index.php\">company</a> that counts.

The first one on the left is going to be a timeline separated in five according to the five categories that we have. Each event is categorise and will appear on the timeline according to their length in time. So more an event was long in time, the more presence it will have on the time line. \r\n\r\nThe second part is a stream chart separated in five according to the categories explaining by the weight of each stream how much people were affected by the event (deaths, injuries and deported people). The flow is variating according to the amount of people affected for every decades (from 1900 to 2010). Also, there is a ranking notion about the information, so the category of event that as the biggest amount of people affected in the decade will be on the extreme right of the poster, the second will be next to it and so ever. Finally, the cost that the event cost to the country will variate the brightness or the saturation of the stream. \r\n\r\nThat's where we are at the end of the third day of our workshop!"

Circles' sizes are proportional to their population density, containing each a couple of their main cities.\r\n\r\nA ring with the 130 ethnical origins is placed around the provinces. And the connections between the ethnical origins and the provinces will show the dominant ethnical groups. We make connections from wider to smaller: From the different ethnic groups > to the provinces > to their main cities.\r\n\r\nThe concept already defined, we still have to process all data to make it fit into the system, its the final step before we can plunge into Nodebox.

We decided to portray every neighbourhood of Montreal based on the total number of trees, the occurrence of each species and the total area covered by each species. For this purpose, every district of Montreal will be modelled according to a tree shape based on three levels: the total population, the genus and the species. The thickness of a single branch will be proportional to the absolute number of trees in the embranchment. A branch\u0092s elongation to the next node is determined by the average tree diameters comprised in that branch. Also, the leaves are described by ellipses that are proportional to the sum of the species trunk area. Leaves are attached to the endings of their respective species. To determine which neighbourhoods are greener, we will calculate the overall area covered by trees over the area of the neighbourhood. Each tree will then be attributed a tint based on its tree representation.\r\n\r\nThe center of the poster will represent the big picture of Montreal\u0092s tree family. Every genus will be pictured by an ellipse proportional to the total trunk area of that genus throughout Montreal.\r\n\r\nGlobally, our poster will answer two straightforward questions: which neighbourhood is the greener and which species of tree is mostly occurring in the city of Montreal?"

Because of the complexity of our data, we had to exclude the cities but the final concept is as clear as it gets: the total amount of people identifying themselves into different countries connected to the 13 provinces of Canada.\r\n\r\nCanadians taking into account in the census could choose different origins countries at the same time, giving that they could have different ethnic ancestors. The total number of people from a given country determine the total of all this answers, this amount is much bigger than the total population in Canada. That's where our main problem was at the time of making relations from one amount into the other. \r\nFor a better data visualization we took into account only the first 100 countries/ethnics containing the most answers, we eliminated the cities and the total population to simplify all the data and just look into one dimension (ethnics > provinces).\r\n\r\nEach Province ends up having a chain code formed by all the ethnic countries converted into proportional squares. The chain resembles to a genetic code which match perfectly with our subject!\r\n\r\nOur visual perfectly meets our objective: showing the principal dominants ethnics in Canada and the different ethnic compositions of each province. It exists a clear dominance of the following ethnics: English, French, Scottish and Irish, but it's interesting to see that not all provinces are composed with those same dominants.\r\n\r\nWe have passed a really intense week and the balance is more than positive: we've learned a lot from Nodebox, how to treat data properly, to understand the code in a much easier way. We also learned that the process can be hard with a small time frame, but with a good plan and hard work we can achieve great things!\r\n\r\nWe passed through all emotions this week: stress, excitement, frustration and at the end a huge sense of accomplishment. All that we've learned will surely be useful in the future!

We wanted to draw the Canada's portrait in terms of vehicles. \r\n\r\nWe thought it would be interesting to look at how much cars each province has and more precisely at the density of motor vehicles for each ones. We soon realized how impressive it was to see the density of provinces such as Nunavut (biggest province, but has the lower vehicles total) The opposite was also true (looking at the Ontario - relatively small-medium province, but has **A LOT** of cars). Then we looked at the different types of vehicles (passengers car - SUVs - Trucks - Buses). Again, the results were sometimes far from what we expected. For the second graphic, we wanted to illustrate how old are the cars (by type) on our roads. Surprisingly, we spent a lot of time trying to organize the visual. At the beginning, it was supposed to be an all vertical graphic. We thought that putting it more horizontal was a better option to expose the results and be able to compare them. \r\n\r\nOur initial sketch showed a 3rd graphic, which is not included in the final poster. The main reason is because we didn't estimate correctly the space the title and the main graphic would take, but also because there was some problems with what we wanted to represent and the datas. Since this last graphic was about driver's gender (still by type of vehicles), the gap between the datas was **HUGE**. For example, looking at all the men driving passenger cars, we had a number that looks like 987654325689877459877... and looking at women driving trucks, we had data like 0,2... So... pretty hard to deal with, even more if with have a really restricted area. We just decided to focus on the final result instead of messing up with Nodebox, and probably get something that wouldn't fit the small space we had left. \r\n\r\nOf course, all the project is based on real data we found on the [Open Data Canada website](http://www.data.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&n=F9B7A1E3-1) mainly in the Transport Minister's section. The hole thing is based on the year 2003 because this year provided us the most useful (and complete) infos. So our poster is about cars in Canada, 10 years from now but it probably didn't changed a lot... Except for the number of SUVs... maybe, who's knows. This would be an interesting second poster to make. Anyway.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop was extremely interesting and enriching. We learned a lot of stuff, of course about NodeBox, but also on how to deal with the data and how to select the right ones to work with. We are now aware that there's is an infinity of possibilities to visually represent datas. NodeBox is an amazing software, you absolutely made us want to go further and explore more the this program. \r\n\r\nDonato and Frederick : Thanks a lot for your time, your advices, all your knowledge and jokes. This week was a really nice one. \r\n\r\n*Hugo Joseph & Marie-Eve Guidi*\r\n\r\n\r\n<-------- The final result of the poster and some close up (hope the pictures will upload correctly)"

If the person's name starts with an 'A', it would be a small dot. 'B' would be a bit bigger and so on up to 'Z' which had the biggest size. This made it much more interesting visually.

Rescue Time tracks which software applications I use, which websites I visit and the amount of time I'm spending on them. Rescue Time also  gives you a productivity score by day. I combined these data with the dates on which I have my period.\r\n\r\nIn this poster you can distinguish three circles, each representing one menstrual cycle of 28 days. The yellow part represents the menstrual days. The greenish blue bars represent my productivity score for each day. The grey circles indicate a productivity score below zero.\r\n\r\nUnder the data visualization you can find an explanation of its main components. As you can notice, the yellow part is smaller than the blue part. The former is based on the average score I had during my menstruation (10.7), the latter constitutes the remainder of days (11.5). \r\n\r\nIn interpreting the data, it appears that I am less productive during my menstruation, but the difference is negligible.

Nodebox program helped me to work with all these skethes at once and categorise them by the date drawn. \r\n\r\nIn this poster objects are colored according to week days. Therefore I found out that in weekends I mostly eat and paint (red and brown objects), wensdays are for drawing clothes (dark blue), thursdays I read books (green). Nodebox is not made to work with images, so Frederic writed a packaging node. It allows to show objects by optimised packing and not in a boring grid. \r\n\r\nThink inside the box or throw away everything you have."

(my nose bleeds even after watching the tutorial at double speed)\r\n\r\nSo behold, because for the next few days of workshops I'll try my best to automate the process, to the point where You would be able to load any image to nodebox and let him do some harcore-deep-dark-magic stuff and surprise You with an eyecandy low poly image. Hurray!\r\n\r\nI'll also try to add a feature that would let You control the size of polys.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo! First things first.\r\nI have to get familiar with all nodes needed for the project. \r\nRight now I have three ideas for getting nodebox to do what I want, so I need to find out which would actually work and from those which are most efficient. The only way to do that is by trying, so not to elaborate, lets get things done!\r\n"
